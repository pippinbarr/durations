"                    WOMAN IN PRISON",
"                  BY CAROLINE H. WOODS",
"",
"                          I.",
"",
"                  FIRST DAY IN PRISON.",
"",
"",
"It was Saturday morning that I became an inmate of the Penitentiary.",
"",
"I was conducted to the kitchen, where I was to oversee the cooking for",
"the prisoners, and to the prison adjoining it, which I was to see kept",
"in order, by the Deputy Master of the institution, who gave me my keys",
"and installed me in my office of Prison Matron.",
"",
"When we first went in he called the six women who do the work in the",
"kitchen, and the three \"sweeps\" who keep the prison clean, to him, and",
"presented their new mistress, in my person, to them.",
"",
"They were convicts that surrounded me at his call; but they were human",
"beings. Human faces looked up to mine for sympathy and care. Some of",
"them were fine looking, even in their coarse uniform, some were pretty",
"as I picked them out one by one. They all looked at me earnestly, for a",
"few moments, as though they were reading their sentence of harshness or",
"kindly treatment, under my rule, in my face; then, turned away to their",
"work again.",
"",
"They whispered as they stood together, and I saw by their furtive",
"glances that they were watching, and discussing me, as I walked around",
"to take a survey of my new field of labor. They were undoubtedly",
"commenting upon my personal appearance; and making their predictions as",
"to my sharpness in detecting their impositions, and ability to control",
"their perverseness; or, I imagined so.",
"",
"The Deputy showed me the mush boiler, that would cook two large tubs",
"full of that farinaceous edible at a time; the potato steamer, that",
"would hold four barrels of that esculent vegetable at a cooking; the",
"soup and coffee kettles, of still larger dimensions; and that comprised",
"all of the apparatus required in preparing the mammoth meals which were",
"to serve above four hundred people. These cooking utensils were kept in",
"operation by pipes conducting steam to them from a boiler stationed in",
"the middle of the room.",
"",
"When he put the steam boiler under my direction I shrank back in terror",
"from the task of managing it. The huge culinary apparatus, which he had",
"been exhibiting, although outside the pale of ordinary housekeeping, was",
"still within the reach of my understanding; but I had no idea of the",
"management of steam; it was not only a difficult, but dangerous affair.",
"",
"\"The house will surely be blown up if you leave the care of that upon",
"me,\" I said to him.",
"",
"\"You must watch it very closely.\"",
"",
"\"I don't know how, and I have no aptness for learning that kind of",
"science.\"",
"",
"\"One of the women will tend it.\" And he went on with explanations that",
"were all Greek to me. \"It is safe when you have on twenty pounds of",
"steam. There is your gauge,\" and he pointed to a clock-like looking",
"affair on the wall. \"That hand will move round and tell you how much",
"steam you have on. You must keep water enough in the boiler or you will",
"get blown up. If it runs from that centre stopcock, on the side, it is",
"safe. You notice that glass tube in front. The water is just as high in",
"that as it is in the boiler. This faucet is to let the water off if you",
"get the boiler too full. Turn that faucet when you let the water on,\"",
"and he went along and pointed to one in a pipe by the wall, \"and that",
"pump is there in case of accident. You must have it worked every day so",
"as to keep it in order.\"",
"",
"All knowledge is useful, I thought, and in time I shall understand",
"running a steam-engine. As the women have been trusted with the",
"dangerous thing, they may still continue to be, till I have leisure to",
"learn the science of steam as applied to cooking.",
"",
"After I had taken a survey of the kitchen the Deputy took me into the",
"women's prison which led out of it.",
"",
"The centre of the hollow square, in which the dormitories are built,",
"looked like a huge block of glittering ice, so white were the washed",
"walls of brick and stone. The black, grated doors of the cells, inserted",
"into them, like the teeth of grinning demons, were ranged along the",
"sides about two feet apart, tier after tier, five stories, one above",
"another.",
"",
"The Deputy led me along past the iron doors. I trembled and shrank back;",
"but I had no idea of receding from my undertaking. I \"screwed my courage",
"to the sticking-point,\" and looked into the narrow, stone rooms; but it",
"was many days before I could force myself to enter one.",
"",
"I grew heart-sick, and faint with apprehension of unknown terrors at",
"their cheerless aspect.",
"",
"\"What lodgings for human beings!\" I exclaimed.",
"",
"\"They are not very pleasant,\" said the Deputy.",
"",
"\"If you were the one to blame for it I should certainly charge you with",
"great inhumanity.\"",
"",
"\"I suppose you will think us very cruel sometimes.\"",
"",
"\"In this case I don't know as you can help it. You did not make these",
"sleeping apartments for the prisoners. The public functionaries of the",
"State may be thanked for showing such tender mercies as these.\"",
"",
"\"We are used to seeing them, and they don't look to us as they do to",
"you.\"",
"",
"\"Does that make them any more comfortable for the prisoners? Do they get",
"used to them so as to be comfortable?\"",
"",
"\"I presume so. I know they are more comfortable places than some had",
"before they came here.\"",
"",
"\"Then it should be the work of the vaunting Christianity of this",
"religious land to raise such degradation to cleanliness, comfort, and",
"respectability.\"",
"",
"\"There might be a great deal done in that direction if people were only",
"disposed to do it.\"",
"",
"\"Our prisons are rather private affairs, I believe. They can only be",
"visited on certain days and occasions.\"",
"",
"\"It would be very inconvenient for our work to have people running in,",
"and over the place at all times. We could not have it. And it wouldn't",
"be liked by the prisoners to be gazed at constantly.\"",
"",
"I made no reply; but I thought it might have a salutary effect upon the",
"discipline of the prison, which he had just said I might think cruel, to",
"be exposed to the observation of the public. The prisoners must have",
"lost the sensibility which would shrink from being made a spectacle",
"before they came in there. If visiting were allowed only on certain days",
"and occasions, the place and the convicts would be put in order for",
"company, and a very incorrect idea of the every-day life of the",
"prisoners would be obtained.",
"",
"If there were liberty to visit the place, every day, many might go from",
"curiosity, and it might become annoying. That very curiosity might",
"discover and discuss faults in the management, which ought to be",
"remedied, and thus produce a counterbalancing benefit.",
"",
"The officers might dislike such scrutiny, especially, if they were not",
"doing their duty. They are officers of the government. Is it not proper",
"that their conduct should be looked after by the people as much as that",
"of any other government official?",
"",
"Evil comrades might go in and hold improper communication with the",
"prisoners. Can they not do that on regular visiting days?",
"",
"Is it not only the work of humanity to see that crime is punished in a",
"way that will not increase it; but also that of the legislator as a",
"matter of civil policy; and that of the taxpayer as a matter of personal",
"interest. It should interest every man and woman as a matter of personal",
"protection from the depredations of vice to know how convicts are",
"treated, and to judge whether that treatment tends to reform the",
"criminal, or to harden and lead him deeper into crime when he is let out",
"into the world again to pursue his own ways.",
"",
"Ought the punishment of criminals, who have been tried, convicted, and",
"sentenced publicly, to be conducted in secret? It is to be presumed that",
"the keeper of the prison is trusty. There should be no presumption in",
"the matter. It should be known that he is so, and he should be kept so",
"by the ceaseless vigilance of public inspection. What is the quarterly,",
"or semi-annual visit of fifty or a hundred men when the visit has been",
"notified, and the prison put in order for their reception, towards",
"effecting that?",
"",
"My residence in that prison led me to see that the descriptions of",
"Dickens, and his compeers in the regions of fictitious writing, have",
"given, not the poetic illusions of imaginary sufferings to the",
"contemplation of the world--hardly a vivid picture of the truth.",
"",
"God speed the day when our prisons and penitentiaries may take a place",
"beside public schools, orphan asylums, houses of refuge, all",
"institutions for the cultivation of a knowledge which tends to the",
"elevation of virtue, and the suppression of vice, in the care of the",
"public!",
"",
"Our own children may not stimulate to an interest in them. Our own",
"children may not require the benefit of the public school, or orphan",
"asylum; but somebody's children will. In working for the elevation of",
"everybody's children are we not benefiting our own?",
"",
"After he had shown me around, so that I might take a general survey of",
"my field of labor, the Deputy left me with my charge, saying,--",
"",
"\"You are mistress here. No one has a right to interfere with you, and",
"you are responsible to no one but me, or the Master.\"",
"",
"\"But the Head Matron will, of course, come and instruct me in the",
"details of my work. I must know what work belongs to each woman, and how",
"she is expected to perform it.\"",
"",
"\"The women know their work and will do it. The most you have to do is to",
"keep order.\"",
"",
"\"That may be a man's idea of managing a kitchen; but there are a great",
"many details that I ought to understand in order to get the work",
"properly done, and done in its proper time; and with the greatest ease",
"to myself and the women.\"",
"",
"\"The other Matrons will tell you. I will tell you all I can.\"",
"",
"I thought, but I did not say it,--You are better disposed than informed.",
"He saw by the anxious expression of my face that I was not satisfied,",
"and added, \"The women know, they will tell you.\"",
"",
"I made no reply; but I thought--It is not the proper thing for me to",
"receive my instructions from the convicts. It is their place to be",
"instructed by me. If I am taught by them, I am placed in an inferior",
"position to them. In order to entertain a proper respect for me they",
"should look up to me as their superior in all things.",
"",
"The arrangement for receiving my directions from them placed me too much",
"in their power also. It would be only indulging natural proclivities to",
"\"play off\" on me under the circumstances; and I could hardly expect",
"these poor, abandoned creatures to be superior to the temptation to do",
"it when the opportunity was afforded them.",
"",
"I could not consider such teachers reliable. If, by misleading me, with",
"regard to a rule of the institution, they could obtain an indulgence, or",
"relieve themselves of a burden, would they not take the advantage which",
"they had of me and do it. I was suspicious that they would.",
"",
"There was, probably, some pride mixed with these considerations, that",
"rebelled against becoming a pupil of convicts when I was their mistress.",
"",
"I stood looking on, or walking around, watching the movements of the",
"women very narrowly, till one of the other Matrons came in. Then, I went",
"to her with a volume of questions.",
"",
"To most of them I received the answer,--",
"",
"\"I don't know about that particularly. I have never had anything to do",
"with this department.\"",
"",
"\"Then, how am I to learn my duties, and get definite orders for the",
"regulation of my work? Is there no Head Matron, no superior officer in",
"the women's prison to whom I can go?\"",
"",
"\"The Master's wife is enrolled as Head Matron, and receives pay as such,",
"but she never comes round.\"",
"",
"\"I would go to her if I knew where to find her.\"",
"",
"\"I don't think she knows much more about it than you do, if you were to",
"go to her. We will all tell you.\"",
"",
"\"But you don't know. If there is a Head Matron, and she is paid for",
"doing the duties of one, why does she not perform them? Is she enrolled",
"head officer of this prison merely to obtain the salary? The government",
"is very obliging to make her office a sinecure.\"",
"",
"I was already perplexed--I was beginning to get vexed.",
"",
"\"Her husband does them for her, perhaps.\"",
"",
"\"Perhaps! Then why is he not here, to tell me the work which belongs to",
"each woman, and how she is to do it; what work is required, and how I am",
"to get my things to do with? But how can the Master attend to his own",
"duties and those of the Head Matron too?\"",
"",
"\"The Deputy will tell you.\"",
"",
"\"He must have his own duties to attend to--how can he perform hers? He",
"is just as willing to tell me as you are, and I don't think he knows any",
"more about my place than you do.\"",
"",
"\"The women know, they will tell you.\"",
"",
"I was thrown back upon the convicts again for my instructions.",
"",
"I went on, despairing of help, to study them out as best I could.",
"Sometimes by asking left-hand questions of the women, and sometimes by",
"getting direct explanations from them; but chiefly by watching the",
"progress of the work. The place seemed to me full of disorder,",
"confusion, and dirt.",
"",
"When the Deputy came round again, I was full of trouble.",
"",
"He said, when I complained to him,--",
"",
"\"You will find things in confusion. The Matron who went away yesterday",
"was inefficient.\"",
"",
"\"Perhaps so,\" I replied; \"but the confusion appears to me to date",
"farther back than the last Matron. It arises from the want of a head",
"officer to regulate affairs.\"",
"",
"\"I have double the trouble on this side, with four Matrons and a hundred",
"women, than with three hundred men and more than a dozen officers on the",
"other.\"",
"",
"\"You would insinuate that women are more difficult to get on with than",
"men. I make a very different solution of the difficulty in this",
"particular case. You are on the ground all of the time; explain his duty",
"to every officer, and see that he does it. That makes the officer's work",
"distinct before him. It is done under your eye, which makes it promptly",
"and well done. If that were the case on this side, we might be as",
"orderly, and have as little trouble in performing our part, as you on",
"yours. The cook tells me that certain work belongs to the slide woman;",
"the slide woman says it belongs to the sink women; the sink women shift",
"it on the steam woman, and so I am kept on the chase, from one to",
"another, for some one to do a piece of labor. I do not know who ought to",
"do it, and they know it. If they do not intend to confuse me, they",
"intend to clear themselves of all the work they can.\"",
"",
"\"Use your own judgment, and call on whom you please. They are all",
"obliged to obey any order that you give.\"",
"",
"\"If I call upon one to do the work that has formerly been done by",
"another, I stir up ill feelings among the prisoners towards each other,",
"and contention, and they think me hard and unjust. It makes me trouble.",
"They obey my order reluctantly, and say, 'That isn't my work.'\"",
"",
"\"If they quarrel, they know the punishment. If they refuse to obey your",
"orders, report them to me, and I will put them where they will be glad",
"to obey.\" He nodded towards the prison door.",
"",
"I knew he must refer to some kind of punishment. I did not know what;",
"but frightful visions of the cruelties of which I had read rose in my",
"imagination, and I said no more.",
"",
"I vowed to myself that I would never get them punished by refusing to",
"obey my unjust exactions if I could help it.",
"",
"My thoughts did not stop with my words. I reasoned with myself. If my",
"ignorance, or bad management, cause me to be unjust towards those women,",
"and if I, by my injustice, arouse their bad temper so as to cause them",
"to be punished, who will be most in fault? I decided that I should be.",
"The question suggested itself to me--If you get them punished unjustly",
"who will avenge them? The All-seeing-Eye will notice, and avenge it. I",
"will be careful.",
"",
"I resolved to feel my way along softly and carefully. There was no",
"relief for my dilemma, except in my own ingenuity to find out the ways",
"of the place, and the proper management to apply to it.",
"",
"",
"",
"",
"                                  II.",
"",
"                               AT NIGHT.",
"",
"",
"At seven o'clock, P. M., came the marching in to supper, and the locking",
"up of all the prisoners.",
"",
"I looked to see, as they filed past me, one by one, if they carried",
"marks of their crimes upon their faces. I saw nothing unusual in the",
"mass; occasionally an individual countenance betrayed the vicious habits",
"which had brought the woman there. If I had not known that they were",
"convicts, I should never have suspected them to be different from the",
"ordinary poor people who are constantly passing along the streets.",
"",
"About sixty of the women in the Penitentiary were employed in the shop",
"upon contract vests, pantaloons, coats, and shirts. There were about",
"fifty employed upon sewing-machines. The rest cut, basted, and finished",
"the work.",
"",
"There were from four to ten in the wash-room. These were all lodged in",
"my domain, with the exception of two or three who slept in the hospital.",
"",
"When they left their work, at night, they were placed in file, in the",
"order of their cells, and marched into the prison past the ration door,",
"where their meals were handed out to them, through a slide, from the",
"kitchen.",
"",
"Their supper was a \"skillet pan\" of mush, or a slice of bread, and a",
"quart of rye coffee, which was taken to their cells to be eaten after",
"they were locked in their rooms--or stone dens, I called them in my",
"indignation. The sight of those little, cramped stone cells recalled to",
"my memory the pictures of dungeons, and imprisonments, and tortures",
"which I had looked at in my childhood till my heart was racked with",
"agony at the cruelties which they portrayed.",
"",
"It was no paper picture that I was looking upon, but a stern reality;",
"and my shrinking spirit asked again and again, as I saw those poor",
"creatures marched in, and immured for the night,--Why did your folly",
"prompt you to undertake such work?",
"",
"Never shall I forget the hissing creak of the sliding bar as it closed",
"them in; or the click of the lock as I turned the key in it, for the",
"first time, upon those poor wretches. Long before I got through with the",
"thirty-six locks, it fell to my share to bolt, my fingers were bruised,",
"and my arm ached; but not so much as my heart.",
"",
"I looked in upon the poor things, one by one, as I locked them in. An",
"agony of pity worked itself into my soul, and oppressed me almost to",
"suffocation.",
"",
"I said to myself--Is this a woman's work? May be. If it must be done, it",
"should be done tenderly. Great God, for Christ's sake, pity them in",
"their cold, damp, narrow cells, and make their straw pallets couches of",
"rest! I prayed mentally as I left the grated doors.",
"",
"I had thought this to be missionary ground. I might teach some of them",
"the way to Eternal Life, and the way to reformation. Alas! I found",
"little chance with those who went to the shop and wash-room. They rose",
"at sunrise, and worked till sunset. No one was allowed to hold",
"communication with them, but their own Overseer, about their work.",
"Neither were they allowed to talk in their cells at night, and they",
"would have been too tired if they had been given the liberty to do so.",
"The taskmaster had been over them all day to drive them, pitilessly, to",
"fulfill their sentence of so many months hard labor in the Penitentiary.",
"",
"I turned away, sadly, from that disappointed hope; but I saw the",
"opportunity still before me to teach the nine, whom I had under my",
"immediate care, to govern their tempers, and their passions, and to lead",
"a new life. It was teaching only that could effect it. They were",
"ignorant of the way to do it.",
"",
"My bonnet and shawl had lain all day upon the table that was placed for",
"my use in the kitchen. The woman, who was to wait upon me in my room,",
"had asked if she should take them up. I had said, no, thinking I might",
"find time to go with her; but that opportunity did not offer.",
"",
"After the women were locked up, the Receiving Matron said to her, \"Take",
"those things to our room! We will go up now,\" she said to me.",
"",
"I started back as she led me to the stone stairs of the prison, and",
"began to ascend them.",
"",
"\"Where are we going?\" I asked in surprise.",
"",
"\"Our room is up here,\" she replied quietly.",
"",
"\"In the prison! are we to sleep in the prison?\"",
"",
"\"Yes.\"",
"",
"She made no further comment. It was too late in the day to recede or",
"demur. I followed her up, up, up, over five stone flights, along a stone",
"walk to the farther end of the building, through a grated door, into a",
"room made up of a half dozen cells with a dormer window in the roof.",
"Some straw had been thrown down upon the stone floor, and an old woolen",
"carpet laid over it. The walls were of stone like the cells, and",
"whitewashed like them. There were some wooden chairs, an old bureau, two",
"sinks, and two single beds, arranged on opposite sides of the room. In",
"one corner was a double wardrobe, apparently to be shared in common by",
"both Matrons.",
"",
"I had not given my own accommodations a thought in taking my place in",
"the prison. In all institutions of the kind which I had ever been in,",
"each Matron had a nice bed-room to herself, in a comfortable part of the",
"house, and most of them comfortable sitting-rooms attached. It never",
"occurred to me that a female officer, in any public institution, could",
"be requested to occupy such a room. However I could bring myself to it",
"for the sake of carrying out the purpose that induced me to take the",
"place.",
"",
"I stood a moment, and looked all round the room. I then examined the",
"bed. It was clean, and looked comfortable.",
"",
"\"Is this all the room, and are these all the comforts we are to have?\" I",
"asked of the Receiving Matron.",
"",
"\"You see all,\" she replied. \"If we had more, we should have no time to",
"enjoy them.\"",
"",
"\"Rather a sorry prospect if one is to take herself into consideration at",
"all. Is there a bath-room that we can use? To take a bath would be",
"really refreshing, and help me to sleep to-night, I am so tired.\"",
"",
"\"I am tired all of the time, and there is no chance to rest. We must",
"rise at four in the morning, and be on the spring every moment till",
"eight in the evening; you will be on duty till nine, because you receive",
"the keys at that hour.\"",
"",
"\"Every day?\"",
"",
"\"Every day!\"",
"",
"\"There is usually a Relief Matron in such institutions, so that the",
"other Matrons can have rest.\"",
"",
"\"There used to be one here; but, instead of that, there is an Assistant",
"Matron in the shop.\"",
"",
"\"Then the Shop Matron has all of the relief, and the others none. Why is",
"that?\"",
"",
"\"They want to get as much work done in the shop as possible, to support",
"the institution, the Master says. When I get tired, and feel like",
"grumbling, I tell them it is money taken out of our flesh and blood to",
"make the institution rich.\"",
"",
"\"It is probably the way the Master takes to recommend himself to the",
"Board of Directors. They like him for his thrift in managing.\"",
"",
"\"I don't know where the money goes; but I know we are worked to death. I",
"am dying by inches.\"",
"",
"\"Why must I be up an hour later than the rest to receive the keys?\"",
"",
"\"Because you have them in charge during the night, those that stay in",
"the prison. If you are out, I take them.\"",
"",
"\"Out! What time have I to go out?\"",
"",
"\"Three evenings in the week, after the prisoners are locked up, if you",
"wish.\"",
"",
"\"What time have I then?\"",
"",
"\"You can be gone till four o'clock in the morning, if you like.\"",
"",
"\"When shall I sleep?\"",
"",
"\"You can make your own arrangements for that. Perhaps on the way, if you",
"take a horse car.\"",
"",
"\"I am afraid to go out evenings alone; but in that relief I can get a",
"bath.\"",
"",
"\"I forgot your question about the bath-room. There is none, that I know",
"of, for the officers' use. There is one in the house for the Master's",
"family. I don't know whether the Matrons that lodge there are allowed to",
"use it.\"",
"",
"\"Then some of the Matrons are lodged comfortably in the house. Why is",
"that distinction made?\"",
"",
"\"I don't know. There are bathing-tubs, for the prisoners, in my",
"wash-house. I never use them; but if you wish to, you can. They are",
"scrubbed out clean.\"",
"",
"\"I must be up from four A. M., 'till nine P. M. That makes seventeen",
"hours of labor.\"",
"",
"\"Sometimes you will be required to sit up one, two, or three hours",
"later.\"",
"",
"\"Why?\"",
"",
"\"The Master's wife or daughters may have company, and keep the women",
"up-stairs. We have to sit up and wait for them to come in, so as to lock",
"them up.\"",
"",
"\"And be up all the same at four next morning?\"",
"",
"\"Yes.\"",
"",
"\"Do the Master's wife and daughters get up at four the next morning,",
"after sitting up so late, and go to work?\"",
"",
"\"Of course not.\"",
"",
"\"If the wife is Head Matron, has she not her duties to do in the morning",
"as well as we? And ought she not to see that the other officers are not",
"worked like that? If she possesses the common feelings of humanity, she",
"would provide some relief, if it were in her power.\"",
"",
"\"There is not much humanity in exercise here. We are all too hard worked",
"to think of any one but ourselves.\"",
"",
"\"I should think that might be your case.\"",
"",
"\"I often tell them it is as much a House of Correction for the officers",
"as the prisoners.\"",
"",
"\"Ten hours of labor is now considered a good day's work. To drag the",
"convicts from sunrise to sunset only exhausts them. They do not get",
"through with as much work as they would do in ten hours, and the",
"intervening time given to rest.\"",
"",
"\"That has been an established rule here for fifty years or more.\"",
"",
"\"It is certainly a very antiquated idea, all of a half century old. I",
"recollect hearing my grandfather say that people worked that way when he",
"was a boy. But people's ideas have changed since that time, and the",
"people of this generation consider such demands of labor very",
"unreasonable.\"",
"",
"\"The only changes here have been to make things harder. They will put",
"upon you all they can make you do.\"",
"",
"If she had been telling the truth that was a plain, but correct",
"statement of facts.",
"",
"\"How long has the present Master had charge here?\"",
"",
"\"Forty-five or fifty years.\"",
"",
"\"It is no wonder that his heart has become like the nether millstone. No",
"man ought to remain in such a place such a length of time. The best",
"human heart that ever beat would become ossified, if it ever entertained",
"human feelings, if compelled to exercise such continued tyrannous",
"exactions.\"",
"",
"\"I don't know whether he ever had human feelings--he does not exercise",
"much humanity, as I regard it, now.\"",
"",
"\"But he does not make the laws for the regulation of the institution.",
"There must be State laws and a Board of Overseers to which he is",
"accountable. There must be printed regulations for the management of",
"this prison. I will get them from the Deputy to-morrow.\"",
"",
"\"If you can, you will accomplish more than the rest of us have been able",
"to do.\"",
"",
"\"I can try.\"",

"",
"I lay down upon my bed. Sleep was out of the question. The effluvia of a",
"hundred human bodies came up through our open door, rank with nauseous",
"odor. I got up and opened our one window to its utmost extent, first",
"asking my room-mate if it would be disagreeable to her to have it left",
"so.",
"",
"Fatigue even would not overcome the noise of the rattling buckets, the",
"snoring, coughing, and groaning of the tired women. If I closed my eyes,",
"my head was in confusion. I was going up, up, up over the stone steps,",
"and looking over the rails down the dizzy height, to the stone floor",
"below.",
"",
"I lay thinking over my prison prospects. Seventeen hours of regular",
"labor, to which might be added occasionally, one, two, or three more.",
"The other seven, with the noise of that prison ringing in my ears, and",
"the care of it, if accident or sickness intervene. How long can any",
"constitution bear such a strain? Surely the Board of Directors cannot",
"understand how things are managed here. They cannot understand the",

"",
"                         SECOND DAY IN PRISON.",
"",
"",
"There was a small bell hung directly over my head; the wire from it",
"reached into the men's prison. It was rung by the watchman at four",
"o'clock in the morning, to call me up.",
"",
"I sprang out of bed at the first tinkle, threw a shawl around me, put my",
"feet into my slippers, ran down, unlocked my steam woman to make her",
"fire, and my cook to start her breakfast. I let them into the kitchen,",
"and locked them in. Then, I went back to dress myself.",
"",
"Up, up, over the five flights, past the grated doors, over the stone",
"walks. The air of that prison sent a chill over me like that of a tomb.",
"Were not those cells the tomb of love, of hope, of peace, and",
"respectability! In them lay buried all of this world's success, all that",
"it values: how much of the inheritance of the life to come God knows.",
"Those black doors were a pall of disgrace of deeper dye than that which",
"covers the coffin with its lifeless clay. I was chilled through and",
"through by my thoughts and the objects that engendered them. And those",
"objects were to be ever there before my sight, while I remained in",
"prison, and those thoughts must ever arise to be my company. I could",
"escape; no prison bar was slid upon me to keep me there; but the",
"convicts _must_ remain. The unyielding lock, the unremitting toil, the",
"pursuing regret, and the torture of remorse were before them, upon them,",
"within them.",
"",
"I might be able to speak to them a word of pity, of hope in a better",
"life to come. The thought gave me courage to go to my day's work.",
"",
"I took no unnecessary time for personal adorning; but my fingers were",
"benumbed and moved slowly. I had scarcely finished dressing when the",
"\"first bell\" rung.",
"",
"That was the large bell in the yard that called all of the prisoners",
"from their beds.",
"",
"At that signal I was to assist in unlocking the rest of the women. If",
"they were not out of their beds when the key was put in the lock, they",
"were called to sharply by the Matron who was with me--",
"",
"\"Come, get up! How dare you lie there after the first bell has rung!\"",
"",
"It might prove necessary to talk to some laggards in that harsh way; but",
"I would try some other method, with those of whom I had the care, first.",
"",
"Yawning, and groaning, and moaning, they dragged themselves out of their",
"beds and made them up. After this was done they tied them up against the",
"wall with a cord which was attached to the iron bars upon which the bed",
"rested, and then passed over a hook in the side of the cell. Then, they",
"stood waiting for the second bell, which was the signal for them to go",
"to work.",
"",
"Poor, pitiable objects, they looked, as they were mustered for the long",
"day's drill of thankless, unrequited toil. They worked without a motive,",
"and they went to it with listless indifference, or the sullen",
"determination to escape all of the task which they could. They",
"accomplished their work as it was driven from them; not by the lash, but",
"by fear of passing the night upon the bare iron bars of their bed-frame;",
"or the stone floor of the solitary cell, without covering beside their",
"ordinary dress, without food, save the daily slice of bread and quart of",
"cold water.",
"",
"Between the ringing of the bells the unlocking had been accomplished.",
"One of the sweeps was stationed at the end of the upper tier of cells.",
"When the second bell rung I called to her,--",
"",
"\"Slide your bar!\"",
"",
"The long bar that runs across the top of all the cells of one division,",
"with a bolt reaching down over each door to keep it shut when it is",
"unlocked, was then drawn out by her, so that the doors could be opened.",
"I then called,--",
"",
"\"Third Division!\"",
"",
"At that they all appeared at their doors.",
"",
"I called, \"Front!\"",
"",
"The doors were opened, and they stood on the threshold.",
"",
"\"Right face!\" All wheeled to the right.",
"",
"\"March!\" was the next order.",
"",
"At that word they marched down the stairs, in the order that they came",
"out of their cells, deposited the ration pan and quart, in which they",
"had carried their supper to their rooms the night before, on the ration",
"table, to be taken into the kitchen and washed, ready to receive their",
"breakfast, which was passed out in them when they came in from work at",
"seven.",
"",
"The other divisions were called out in the same way, and followed in",
"their order.",
"",
"Unrefreshed, sleepy, and without energy, they moved along to their two",
"hours of labor before breakfast. And such a breakfast to look forward to",
"when it came. Rye coffee and mush, varied with brown bread once a week,",
"and this purposely stinted to the least possible amount which one could",
"subsist on and work.",
"",
"I noticed that most of them took only their coffee, and worked upon that",
"when it was brown bread morning till the noon meal came.",
"",
"Many a one looked into her quart, as she passed me, and sighed out, \"God",
"help us!\"",
"",
"\"May He help you! He only can--I cannot,\" was my response; but not",
"always made audibly.",
"",
"He only knew how I longed to do so. I often said to myself, as the days",
"passed on, I would not starve a dumb dog as those poor human things are",
"starved. I would not work a dumb animal as those poor human things are",
"worked! Nor would the Master feed his horse as they were fed; nor would",
"he stall him as those prisoners were lodged.",
"",
"I did what I could for them. I asked the Deputy if he could not",
"substitute flour bread for the brown which they refused. He answered,--",
"",
"\"No! They will come to it. The Master will not change the order.\"",
"",
"They did not come to it. And day after day, as I saw them go",
"breakfastless to their work, I wished,--was it wrong? perhaps so,--that",
"the avenger might be on the track of that unfeeling Master, and that the",
"day might come when he might be obliged to breakfast upon a quart of rye",
"coffee and a slice of brown bread, instead of the steaks, and eggs, and",
"toasts, and other delicacies that I saw carried to his room from the",
"kitchen, as I passed through it to the officers' dining-room.",
"",
"If it aroused such indignation to witness such cruelty, what must it do",
"in the hearts of those who suffer from it! Does such correction of",
"convicts tend to arouse better purposes in their hearts than those which",
"brought them into prison? Such treatment aroused in them anger and",
"revenge. When they dared, and in every way which they could invent",
"without laying themselves liable to punishment, they gave expression to",
"their feelings.",
"",
"When they were dismissed from the prison, the officer usually remarked,",
"\"We shall have that boarder back again.\"",
"",
"The answer that I should have made, had I spoken my thoughts, would have",
"been--The whole tendency of their discipline here is to produce that",
"end.",
"",
"The first thing that I did, after breakfast was over, was to take the",
"names of my six kitchen women, and learn, as nearly as I could, just",
"what work belonged to each one of them.",
"",
"There were two sink women, McMullins and Magill. Their work was to wash",
"the dishes, keep the sink clean, and scrub about one quarter of the",
"floor. The slide woman scrubbed the ration table, a certain portion of",
"the floor, washed the quarts and piled them up, scrubbed the table in",
"the centre of the room, took care of the flour bread when it came in,",
"and the pieces that were left. At meal time she passed out the coffee,",
"and put the potatoes in the ration pans.",
"",
"The cook made the mush, which was boiled twice a day, the soup, and",
"hash, and stewed the peas. She had a certain portion of the floor to",
"scrub, and the room to keep tidy, as well as her boilers to wash.",
"",
"The steam woman took care of the steam boiler, made the coffee, helped",
"the cook slice the meat, and kept her portion of the floor clean. It was",
"a part of her work to pile the ration pans in rows of pyramids on the",
"centre table.",
"",
"The one who tended the women's slide had one half of the floor to scrub,",
"and the Master's furnace, which stood in the centre of the kitchen, to",
"tend.",
"",
"There were many things to be done in common, where all helped; like the",
"carrying out of the swill, which was emptied into tubs when the ration",
"pans came in to be washed. That was carried a long way down the yard,",
"poured into barrels, and left for the yard man to take to the piggery.",
"",
"They all helped to bring up the potatoes, four barrels at a time, wash",
"them in the sink with a large bat-stick, and then put them in the boiler",
"to be cooked by steam.",
"",
"To make the confusion more confounded, the work was changed round, and",
"new hands put to it, the day I went there. The bringing up of the coal,",
"for the steam boiler, which had heretofore devolved upon the steam",
"woman, was now required of all the rest, to be divided among them,",
"because the steam woman had had a broken wrist, and it was not quite",
"strong again. That gave dissatisfaction, and created grumbling, and the",
"constant contention of shifting the labor from one to the other. The",
"rest were constantly fretting Allen, the steam woman, because she asked",
"it of them.",
"",
"To settle the difficulty I asked the Deputy, when he came round,--\"who",
"should bring up the coal for Allen?\"",
"",
"\"Any of them that you see fit to order.\"",
"",
"That was an excellent hint to me. Allen had been in the habit of giving",
"her own orders, which made it necessary for me to interfere continually",
"so as to get them executed, and also to keep peace. They invariably",
"answered her back with refusal when she asked for coal, and made",
"altercation over every bucket that was needed.",
"",
"All orders, like information, were given promiscuously. I at once gave",
"direction that all orders were to be given through me.",
"",
"\"Allen, when you wish for coal, come to me for it!\"",
"",
"Orders had no authority when given by one to another; and by watching I",
"discovered that Allen was disposed to retaliate the little peckings she",
"received, by making the one that aggravated her most bring up the most",
"coal.",
"",
"It was more than one day's work to bring them to this arrangement. So I",
"made it another rule that when they differed they were never to answer",
"back; but come to me to settle the trouble. That was rather more",
"difficult to establish than the first, they were so hot-headed, and",
"anxious to defend themselves.",
"",
"O'Sullivan, one of the slide women, undertook to try my authority on the",
"first order which I gave for coal. She sat idly upon her table, and I",
"asked her to bring it up.",
"",
"A scowl came over her face, she hesitated, and then answered,--",
"",
"\"She's just as well able to bring up the coal as I.\"",
"",
"\"That's so! that's so!\" came from three or four other voices.",
"",
"\"Stop! every one! It is the order that Allen is not to bring up coal;",
"you have nothing to say about it.\"",
"",
"The others were silenced.",
"",
"\"O'Sullivan, will you bring up a bucket of coal?\"",
"",
"\"I'm not going to bring up her coal; she's as well able to fetch it up",
"as I.\"",
"",
"\"You will do just what I tell you! Go now and bring a bucket of coal!\"",
"",
"She started, after looking me in the eye a few seconds to see whether",
"she could succeed if she attempted to disobey.",
"",
"\"When you come back I will talk with you about it.\"",
"",
"I must have prompt obedience. I saw that her condition, that of",
"motherhood, required consideration.",
"",
"While she was gone Allen came to me and whispered,--",
"",
"\"They never lock up women like her, so she takes the advantage.\"",
"",
"After she had brought up the coal, and sat down upon the table again, I",
"went along to her, laid my hand upon her shoulder, stooped down, and",
"said softly,--",
"",
"\"I see the condition that you are in,--I know that it requires care,--I",
"am a mother,--I will see that you do no more than your part. You will do",
"as I wish in future, pleasantly, will you?\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am!\"",
"",
"I then called them all around me, and said to them,--",
"",
"\"The bringing up of the coal for the steam boiler is to be divided among",
"you. I will give each her share of it to do as equally as I can. If any",
"one of you thinks she is doing more than belongs to her, rightfully,",
"make no talk about it, but come directly to me, and I will see that it",
"is made right.\"",
"",
"My first object was to lead the women to make me the central, regulating",
"power, in the kitchen, so that I could reduce the chaotic state of",
"affairs to something like order.",
"",
"\"In a week,\" I said to the Deputy that day, \"I hope to get something",
"like order established.\"",
"",
"\"I will give you a month to get the run of things.\"",
"",
"\"You want the meals well cooked, and promptly passed out at the time;",
"the place kept quiet and clean.\"",
"",
"\"That is what we want.\"",
"",
"\"Be patient, and in a week or two we shall arrive at that.\"",
"",
"\"I shall find no fault till I see occasion.\"",
"",
"That night, after the work was done, I called them all around me, and",
"told them they would find me kind and pleasant, if they were obedient.",
"If they were not, they would surely find themselves in trouble, because",
"it was a part of my duty to make them obey, and it must be done by the",
"rules of the institution; I could not change them. I saw that their work",
"was hard; but I would make it as easy as possible. The work was there,",
"and they were put there to do it. The more willingly they undertook it,",
"the easier it would go off. If they tried to help themselves, I would",
"help them.",
"",
"They all assented, and thus we made a compact to be kind to each other.",

"",
"                       A QUARREL, AND DISCIPLINE.",
"",
"",
"It was my third morning in prison. I stood beside the mush boiler with",
"Annie O'Brien, who had been scraping it, and was wiping it out with a",
"dry cloth.",
"",
"McMullins came along, and demanded the cloth from her. An altercation",
"ensued. I hushed the noise, and asked,--",
"",
"\"To whom does the cloth belong?\"",
"",
"\"It is my dish-cloth,\" said McMullins.",
"",
"\"You might let me have it a moment just to wipe this out!\"",
"",
"\"I want it meself, I'm in hurry for it.\"",
"",
"\"Where is yours?\" I asked O'Brien.",
"",
"\"I don't know, ma'am. I left it on the boiler, and some one has taken",
"it.\"",
"",
"She still kept on using McMullins'.",
"",
"\"I want my dish-cloth; I'm in hurry,\" said McMullins, impatiently.",
"",
"\"Give her the dish-cloth, and go find your own!\" I said.",
"",
"Annie O'Brien's temper was like a lucifer match. At the command she",
"threw the cloth in McMullins's face.",
"",
"Quick as a cat would spring upon a mouse, McMullins was upon her; and",
"the report of the slaps that fell quick, and followed each other fast on",
"the side of O'Brien's face, sounded through the room.",
"",
"It was in vain that I called upon them to stop. O'Brien was enraged. She",
"caught up an iron rod that lay upon the window seat, and struck",
"McMullins a blow upon her forehead that brought blood.",
"",
"I called the other women to the spot, and they were soon parted.",
"",
"I sent McMullins out of the room, took O'Brien, who was white with",
"anger, by the arm, and led her to a seat.",
"",
"\"Sit down!\"",
"",
"She looked defiance for a moment; then, did as I commanded her.",
"",
"\"What kind of behavior is this, Annie O'Brien?\" I asked, sternly.",
"",
"\"She slapped me in the face--slapped in the face by that low hussy!\"",
"",
"The thought added fuel to her rage, and she started up again as though",
"to pursue her.",
"",
"\"Be quiet!\"",
"",
"She sat down again. I stood silent by her.",
"",
"\"She slapped me in the face; by ----, I will not bear it!\"",
"",
"She darted past me, and caught up a carving-knife that lay on the",
"table.",
"",
"\"She slapped me in the face; and, by ----, I will have her heart's",
"blood!\"",
"",
"My heart sickened at the disgusting scene; but my duty was before me.",
"",
"\"Stop her, and take the knife away!\" I shouted to the women at the other",
"end of the room.",
"",
"In a moment the knife was taken from her, and both of her hands were",
"confined by four of the women.",
"",
"\"Annie O'Brien, come here!\" I called.",
"",
"She looked at me, but did not stir.",
"",
"I called again, \"Annie O'Brien, come here!\"",
"",
"She said to the women that held her, \"Let me go! I will go to her,\" and",
"she started towards me.",
"",
"I laid my hand on her pale, cold cheek.",
"",
"\"O'Brien, are you not ashamed to get so angry with that poor, foolish,",
"half-crazed McMullins?\"",
"",
"\"Wouldn't it make your blood boil to have any one slap you in the face?\"",
"",
"\"Undoubtedly it would rouse my temper for the moment. It is a very mean",
"and wrong thing to strike; but you have behaved no better.\"",
"",
"\"I was a fool; but I could not help it.\"",
"",
"\"Yes, you could. Will you behave yourself now?\"",
"",
"\"I will do nothing more,\" and she heaved a deep sigh.",
"",
"\"If you have really come to your senses, go about your work!\"",
"",
"She returned to her work; but in a moment she called to me,--",
"",
"\"You must report me!\"",
"",
"\"Yes, in my own time.\"",
"",
"\"You must report me now; I must be punished. They will blame you if you",
"put it off.\"",
"",
"\"Would you care if they blamed me, Annie?\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am, I should. It is bad enough for me to behave so without",
"making you any more trouble.\"",
"",
"\"I wish to see you entirely over your frenzy, perfectly quiet, before I",
"call the Deputy.\"",
"",
"\"I am perfectly quiet,\" and she went about making her mush.",
"",
"\"Annie, if you will promise me to try to control your temper in future,",
"I will try to get your punishment made as light as possible.\"",
"",
"\"I will try to do anything you want me to; but they will put it on to me",
"hard, I've been punished so many times before.\"",

"\"Keep about your work as though nothing had happened!\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am.\"",

"in the entry for him, and stated the case before he went in to punish",
"the women.",
"",
"\"McMullins gave the first blow; you know she is a poor, foolish thing;",
"she has fits. You won't punish her this time, will you? She slapped",
"O'Brien in the face, and she struck back. Won't you let them off this",
"time?\"",
"",
"\"I can't. It won't do.\"",
"",
"\"Wouldn't it make you angry, and wouldn't you strike back if any one",
"struck you in the face?\"",
"",
"\"Probably I should.\"",
"",
"\"You won't punish her for doing what you would do yourself?\"",
"",
"\"I must.\"",
"",
"\"If one is punished both must be. The trouble began in Annie's not",
"having her own things to use. I will see that each has her own things in",
"future, and avoid cause of contention in that way as much as possible.",
"If McMullins should have a fit in her cell, we should both feel bad.",
"Can't you let them off with a reproof this time?\"",
"",
"\"I can't. McMullins must not count on the fool's pardon when she fights.",
"If I let her go now she might fly in any woman's face at any time. They",
"never would be safe from her slappings. Don't you think they ought to be",
"punished?\"",
"",
"\"Yes, sir; with some kind of punishment.\"",
"",
"\"If I were to let them off, it would be known all through the prison in",
"two hours, and there would be rebellion in all quarters.\"",

"\"I am sorry; but I have no other way.\"",

"delivered herself up to him without a word; but McMullins cried, and",
"begged him not to lock her in a black cell.",
"",
"He made no reply, but pointed them to the prison. As he went, he asked",
"me to bring No. 1 key.",
"",
"The black cells are of the same size, and made like the others. The only",
"difference between them is, that the doors of the black cells are closed",
"from the entrance of all light by a black board placed against the bars.",
"",
"They have no beds in them, not a blanket to lie upon. Nothing but the",
"cold stones to sit, to stand upon, or to lean against. The only article",
"of furniture allowed in them is the night bucket, which may be converted",
"into a seat. The rations, when in that \"durance vile,\" is one quart of",
"water, and one thin slice of bread during the twenty-four hours.",
"",
"With a heavy heart I saw my poor women locked up. I turned the key upon",
"them with my own hand.",
"",
"O this continual turning of keys! The bunch in my hand all day, under my",
"pillow at night.",
"",
"Click, click, when I go out of the room; click, click, when I come in.",
"Will my ears ever harden to the sound so that I shall not notice it!",
"",
"It is a constant drill, drill to labor under the ever impending",
"punishment, which hangs over the prisoner, suspended by a breath of",
"complaint by an officer. Is one kind of punishment the only cure for",
"disobedience? Should it not be mitigated by mercy, or changed in",
"character according to the circumstances, or the peculiar disposition",
"of the offender? How does the Great Lawgiver treat His convicts? Does He",
"punish all offenders with the same unmitigated rigor? His sun shines",
"alike on the evil and the good. He reproves often, and teaches, and",
"suffers long, and is kind, and adapts His punishment to the character of",
"the crime committed.",
"",
"Some crime is committed in willful disobedience of known law; but much",
"more of it in ignorance of the way to control bad tempers--in ignorance",
"of the way to resist temptation.",
"",
"Teaching is what these poor creatures want, and the time in which to",
"learn.",
"",
"Many a time I went to the key-holes of those black cells to listen that",
"day. Many a time I called,--",

"",
"\"I cannot. You did wrong and must be punished.\"",

"\"I'll never do it again, I am so tired. Please will you get the Deputy",
"to let me out.\"",
"",
"\"Just as soon as I can.\"",
"",
"That night I went to him, and begged to have my women let out.",
"",
"\"You know McMullins has fits, and to lie there on the cold stones all",
"night might bring them on.\"",
"",
"\"You may put her in her own room to sleep.\"",
"",
"\"Thank you! It is a favor done to me as well as her. I don't think I",
"could sleep at all if she were left lying there. You will let O'Brien go",
"to hers--it would be hardly right to let one sleep in her bed, and not",
"the other.\"",

"It was not for me to decide the right or wrong of the Deputy's orders,",
"to a prisoner.",
"",
"\"McMullins has fits, and it would not be safe to leave her in solitary",

"because you must, do you?\"",
"",
"\"No, ma'am; but it don't seem hardly fair to let one out, and not the",
"other.\"",

"\"Did you say it at last?\"",

"",
"\"I shall always treat you with respect. I could never be mean enough to",

"",
"She fulfilled her promise. Never yet have I met a human being that",

"then I should have been punished. Didn't you send me away on purpose?\"",
"",
"\"If I did, it was better than scolding.\"",

"One order that I noticed gave me great satisfaction, and had it been",

"prison from what then obtained. It was, that \"no irritating language\"",
"should be used to the prisoners. Had that rule been observed, there",
"would have been comparatively few \"in solitary,\" to the number which",
"came under my observation.",

"I came to the conclusion that if the rules which governed the",
"institution had been subjected to the approval of the Board of",
"Directors, that august body must entertain a very imperfect idea of",
"their practical working.",
"",
"One of my orders was to stand at the ration table, in the kitchen, while",

"time, on duty, which shut me out of the kitchen entirely.",

"The trouble that arose from the conflicting orders was this. After I",
"left the kitchen, the food for the meals was under the control of the",

"women abstracted a part of it from some of the pans, or changed it from",
"one pan to another.",
"",
"I was allowed about two hundred and eighty pounds of meat for the four",
"hundred prisoners, bones included. After this was sliced, it was divided",
"to each pan as nearly equally alike as possible. To this was added three",

"",
"These pans were arranged in rows across the ration table, to be passed",

"",
"Was it strange, with this opportunity placed in their way, that they",
"should help themselves to the meat which had been divided to the others?",
"",
"My order was to detect the thief and report her. That was much easier",
"said than done. My opinion was that they all took it.",
"",
"It was a question strongly debated in my mind, who was most at fault,",
"those poor, half-starved things, for taking the meat when the",
"opportunity was given them, or those who put the temptation in their",
"way?",
"",
"I did not decide it in season to have any of them punished for breaking",
"the rule.",
"",
"When the convicts got angry with each other, they would report on the",
"one they were offended with; but it was an established rule that the",
"testimony of one prisoner was not to be taken against another, and I had",
"not the least inclination to break the rule.",
"",
"I did discover one of the thieves at last; but I took my own way to",
"punish her.",
"",
"The steam woman got angry with one of the slide women, and reported her",
"to me one day when the dinner came short.",
"",
"\"Never mind now, Allen; but the next time you see her take it, tell me",
"where she hides the meat. I will go find it; and then, she can't turn it",

"",
"A day or two afterwards, Allen whispered to me,--",
"",
"\"You look on the top of the bread closet in the cellar, and you will",
"find something.\"",
"",
"I went down, mounted some false steps, and found a quart filled with",
"slices of meat. I took it up into the kitchen, and asked,--",
"",
"\"Who hid this meat away on the top of the bread cupboard in the cellar?\"",
"",
"Not one of them answered.",
"",
"\"Will the one who did it be honest enough to own it; or will she be mean",
"enough to let me lay the blame on some one else? Did you do it, Annie",
"O'Brien?\"",
"",
"\"No, ma'am.\"",
"",
"\"Will you tell me who did it?\"",
"",
"\"I don't know, ma'am.\"",
"",
"\"Allen, did you do it?\"",

"\"No, ma'am.\"",

"\"I am going to ask you all, and I hope no one will be mean enough to lie",

"",
"\"I put it there,\" said O'Sullivan.",
"",
"\"Who did you put it away for?\"",
"",
"\"For myself, because I don't like peas.\"",
"",
"\"Very well, O'Sullivan; but you were rather too generous to yourself.",
"Half of that would have been enough for your dinner, and to punish you",
"for being so selfish, you can't have any of it. I shall give it to the",
"others. Your hiding it away down there, gave it very much the appearance",
"of stealing. In future, when you wish to put anything away, show it to",
"me, and then, put it away like an honest woman. But you are never to put",
"anything away unless it is left over, after I have divided the meat. It",
"would be very mean to take a double portion for yourself, and make the",
"poor fellows on the other side go without.\"",
"",
"I had been studying the Rules and Regulations of the Board, and",
"discovered that I was to admonish once, before reporting for punishment.",
"I did not propose to transcend that rule.",
"",
"\"Now, remember, there is nothing more to be hid away from me.\"",
"",
"\"There isn't much danger, as long as you let us tell you all about it.\"",
"",
"\"I shall always let you tell me, before I get you punished; but you must",
"always obey, and then there will be no punishment.\"",
"",
"\"I suppose it is only right that we should eat our share of peas with",
"the rest, for they can't get even bread and coffee as we can.\"",
"",
"\"It is certainly wrong for you to take another prisoner's meat; and very",
"mean, because, as you say, he has not the chance you have to get",
"anything else. Now, girls, will you promise not to hide things away, and",
"try to cheat me any more?\"",
"",
"\"I will, I will,\" was responded by the six. I did not expect them to do",
"it without a great many more \"admonishings.\"",
"",
"\"Now, girls, be on your guard, so that the temptation does not become",
"too strong for you.\"",

"\"You consider them a very intelligent body of men, do you not?\"",

"\"Of course,--they are my superior officers.\"",
"",
"\"How can they expect me to be in two different places at the same time?\"",

"\"I really don't know much about the arrangements on the women's side at",
"meal times. My station is in the men's prison at that time.\"",

"\"Yes, sir; and it is the place of our head officer to be stationed on",

"in the kitchen at meal time, to see that the meals go out properly, and",
"that none of them are turned from the right channel.\"",

"The next day afforded him an illustration of what I said. The dinner",
"fell short. He entered the kitchen at one door as I went in at another.",
"He came hurrying up to me, and asked--\"Why is this?\"",

"\"I don't know, sir! It was all right when I left the kitchen. Since",
"that, I have no means of knowing what has been going on. I have been",
"shut out in the prison, on duty.\"",

"\"It is a rule, is it, that the prisoners are not to be left alone a",
"moment at night, after they are locked in?\"",

"",
"\"Of course you must do that.\"",
"",
"\"Then I must leave the prison alone. Have the Board of Directors",

"\"The reason why I asked was, because the Supervisor and Shop Matron",

"difficulty last night.\"",
"",
"\"Did you have any difficulty last night?\"",
"",
"I told him the story of Haggerton, and Mrs. Hardhack's management in the",
"case.",

"",
"\"Mrs. Hardhack has been here many years--she ought to know better than",

"\"The order of the Board is to work from sunrise to sunset. There is no",

"\"You are sharp. I see you wish to do your own duty, and you wish others",
"to do the same.\"",
"",
"\"Yes, I like to do my duty if I can find out what it is. In this",
"particular case, I am indifferent whether others do theirs or not. But,",
"if I find them following me up to make me perform mine accurately, when",

"The moment that Mrs. Hardhack was out of the prison, that night, the",

"up, directly, to play off on me, which I strongly suspected, her",

"",
"\"Sorry for what,--that you made disturbance, or that I found you out?\"",

"",
"She thought it was through my kindness that she escaped punishment. I",
"had been reading the \"Rules and Regulations,\" which directed me to",
"\"admonish\" once; and then, report for punishment. By following those",
"Rules, I had silenced the noise, and restored order without resorting",
"to punishment. I had also secured the future good behavior of the girl.",
"",
"When one was detected, the others became quiet.",
"",
"There are good and noble qualities still existing in those prisoners, if",
"the right management only be applied to rouse, and bring them into",
"action. The rule to admonish was a wise one, and was adopted to that",

"suffering to the prisoners.",
"",
"No instance came under my observation where the offense was repeated,",
"after a prisoner had been admonished.",
"",
"After quiet was restored, I sat down to think, and rest. I was tired of",
"the ceaseless surveillance, the turning of keys, the grating of bars,",
"the driving of the prisoners at their tasks, the compelling to pleasant",
"manners while under such severe exactions of toil.",
"",
"I sat thinking it over and asking myself if it would be possible for me,",
"driven, urged to work with no alternative but the solitary cell, and the",
"bread and water diet, with no motive but fear of punishment, to be",
"gentle and patient.",
"",
"The exhausted flesh and the wearied spirit would express their agony in",
"some form of complaint. Human nature might restrain its indignation at",
"such a dreary lot from breaking forth, in fear of a greater punishment.",
"The prisoner might work on in silence till she fell, and was carried to",
"the Hospital. I was told that it had been so, and I could not doubt it.",
"",
"My orders verified the statement. I was to keep them at work. If they",
"complained they were to see the Doctor, and he was to decide whether",
"they were unfit for labor. In that case they were to go into the",
"Hospital.",
"",
"I had asked, \"Shall their whole task be exacted of them?\"",
"",
"\"Yes,--if you listen to their complaints, they will all play sick, and",
"we shall get no work done.\"",
"",
"I had said, \"They might do something, and by not being driven so hard,",
"made useful, and their health spared.\"",
"",
"\"We have no such rules,\" was the reply.",
"",
"\"But any Matron, after she is acquainted with her women, can judge so",
"that they will not impose upon her very much.\"",
"",
"\"They will all cheat, and lie, and shirk, if they can.\"",
"",
"That might be so generally; but I knew that I had women who would rather",
"work reasonably than be idle, because time passed faster when they were",
"employed, if from no other motive.",
"",
"If they would all lie, and cheat, and shirk, the discipline that was",
"applied to them did not work any reformation in their characters.",
"",
"The treatment meted out to them was hard, unremitting toil, enforced by",
"harsh words and punishment.",
"",
"Implicit obedience to arbitrary rules was exacted, with no reasons given",
"why they were enforced, and no explanations for their necessity. The",
"hard work, the solitary cell, the meagre food, the damp stone prison,",
"the narrow cells, and the crawling vermin, all went in revision before",
"me.",
"",
"Can such discipline soften the heart, and turn its stern purposes to",
"commit crime into the ways of virtue? Must not the hearts of these poor",
"things inevitably grow harder under such influences, till they become",
"the human fiends which they sometimes manifest themselves?",
"",
"I looked along the whitewashed floor. Rats and mice were running",
"fearlessly about, holding gay revel over the crumbs that had been",
"scattered to them by the prisoners in their rooms.",
"",
"I looked up at the cells. Human faces stared down upon me, through the",
"bars, made ghastly by the flickering gas-light. There were human hearts,",
"alive with all human emotions, beating beneath those horrid faces.",
"",
"Directly in front of me, with no light, save one narrow, stinted ray,",
"which glimmered through the key-hole, with no bed but the stone floor,",
"no seat but the wooden bucket, nothing to lean against but the bare",
"brick walls, lay a girl \"in solitary.\"",
"",
"No human being has life enough to stir up those cold stones to warmth,",
"no change can soften them to comfort. Whichever way she turns, the hard,",
"chilling granite is her resting-place. She lies there with no covering",
"but her usual clothing, and that has been dealt out to her with the",

"",
"Like a flash the thought crossed my brain, If that were my child! It",

"sweet faces of my own daughters transformed to human demons by the vile",
"impress of crime, and its compeer, punishment.",
"",
"Was I putting my hand to the work to help on the hardening of human",
"hearts, and the degradation of human beings! I would flee the place, and",
"leave the work with the morning light. I could not flee the thoughts.",
"Wretched, wretched employment!",
"",
"I was half frenzied. I started up and rushed around the prison. I laid",
"my head against the iron bars of the grated doors. I leaned against the",
"cold stone walls. I could have lain down upon them in bitter penance for",
"the part which I had taken.",
"",
"The eight o'clock bell rung for inspection. It was a relief.",
"",
"Humbly I took my lantern, and crept softly round to examine the locks.",
"Many of the women were in bed, some of them were up reading.",
"",
"One of the girls looked up to me with a smile, and said,--I wondered",
"that she could smile at all,--",
"",
"\"See how nicely I keep the rats out.\"",
"",
"She had taken off the cover of her box, and braced it, by the box,",
"against the lower part of the door.",
"",
"Every room is furnished with a box which has a drawer in it. This box",

"\"Can't they jump over that?\"",

"\"They don't try; but run along to another room. There hasn't been one in",

"",
"I sat down and busied myself reading till the nine o'clock locking came.",
"When that was accomplished, I went up, up, up the stone stairs to my",
"cell in the roof of the prison.",
"",
"I laid me down, and from sheer exhaustion fell into a kind of slumber;",
"but my short sleep, if it were sleep, was rank with nightmare, or",
"haunted with the ghosts of my abode. No sooner did I become unconscious,",
"than I was falling from my eyrie to the rocky floor below, or was",
"strapped upon the iron bars that held the prisoners' beds. Visions",
"appeared to my dream-sight that roused me with a start and scream to",
"wakefulness again.",
"",
"Even such disturbed slumber had hardly got possession of my faculties",
"when a volley of oaths came rolling through my door, and roused me to",
"distinct consciousness.",
"",
"I sprang from my bed, ran to the door, and called,--",
"",
"\"What is the matter?\"",
"",
"\"That bloody Smith snores so that we can't sleep!\"",
"",
"\"Where is she? I will go down and wake her.\"",
"",
"\"On the third division, south side, almost to the foot.\"",
"",
"I put my feet into my slippers, wrapped a shawl around me, and ran down",
"to Smith's door.",
"",
"\"Smith, turn over! You are snoring so loud that the other women can't",
"sleep.\"",
"",
"\"O! how you scared me.\"",
"",
"\"Do you know that you are snoring so loud that the women can't sleep?",
"Turn over on your side!\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am.\"",
"",
"I went back to my bed, but no sooner had I settled myself to sleep than",
"the clamor of complaint was renewed.",
"",
"\"That bloody Smith is at her snoring again!\"",
"",
"Again I started for the second division, south side.",
"",
"\"Smith! you are snoring again!\"",
"",
"\"I can't help it, ma'am! don't have me punished.\"",
"",
"Punished! How the idea haunted them, even in their sleep. \"I know you",
"can't help it, only by turning over. Turn on your face, and try that.",
"The women must sleep, they are tired, and they are obliged to work",
"to-morrow.\"",
"",
"\"I'll try not to snore, ma'am!\" She turned on her face as I directed",
"her.",
"",
"At last I attained to that state of repose which the renowned Sancho",
"Panza has so felicitously eulogized, and successfully immortalized; but",
"my enjoyment was not of long duration.",
"",
"It was but a short distance that reached into the middle of the dark,",
"dismal night, and time had travelled it when I slowly awoke. Shivers of",
"terror, from some undefined cause, crept over me. Gradually I came to a",
"knowledge of what was passing. My hair, which was thrown loosely over",
"the pillow, was moving as though trodden by some nocturnal agent of",
"locomotion. What moved it? there was no draft of air in the room.",
"",
"I put my hand to the \"crowning ornament by Nature given\" to my head, and",
"imprisoned a mammoth mouse, or scarce grown rat.",
"",
"I was fast getting initiated into the mysteries of prison life, and",
"inured to its peculiarities. Unmoved, I might allow my hair to become a",
"bed for rats and mice; but I could not spare the sleep.",
"",
"I threw the creature from me, in a fret at being disturbed, and issued a",
"peremptory order, independent of the Master, and without the approval of",
"the Board, for all rats and mice to pay respect to my person, and my",
"apartments, and trouble me no more. Then I turned over, and went to",
"sleep again.",
"",
"Adverse fate, or some other mysterious personage was on my track that",
"night. Before I had time to close my eyes, a shrill shriek of horror",
"resounded through the building, starting the echoes from every side.",
"",
"It sounded in my ears like the despairing cry of one doomed to eternal",
"death. Imagination supplied the cause, and brought me to my feet with",
"one bound.",
"",
"Some pent up prisoner was dying alone in his cell. I sprang to the rail",
"and called,--",
"",
"\"What is the matter?\"",
"",
"\"I think I had the nightmare. I do have it sometimes.\"",
"",
"\"Was that you, Mary McCullum?\"",
"",
"\"I think it was, ma'am. I'm sorry I waked you! Never mind me, ma'am!\"",
"",
"Poor Mary McCullum! In a moment I remembered all about her. They had",
"told me a sad tale about her incarceration for the murder of her rival.",
"",
"Mary's husband had left her, taking her three little girls away, and",
"married another woman. Mary, in a fit of jealous madness, had ground up",
"a knife, enticed the woman to drink with her, and murdered her in her",
"cellar. A policeman had detected her in the act. God pity, and judge",
"her! She had been sentenced to ten years of hard labor in the",
"Penitentiary for the crime.",
"",
"Five years had been worked out. Her health was gone, her nervous system",
"had become a wreck. The damp rooms, the chilling stones, the ceaseless",
"toil, were the slow torture that had undermined her constitution, and",
"consumed her vitality.",
"",
"Her narrow cell had become, to her imagination, the home of demons who",
"haunted her with her crime.",
"",
"The other women had told me that the ghost of the murdered woman came to",
"Mary McCullum every night, all in her bloody garments, and set her",
"shrieking in her dreams.",
"",
"Should such a criminal go unpunished? The halter could bring no surer",
"death than what was slowly creeping upon her. Restrained of her liberty",
"she should be, and from the power to do further harm. Labor for her own",
"support should be required of her. Connected with it, a sufficient",
"amount of rest to secure health, a place to sleep free from the damp and",
"noisome air of a stone prison.",
"",
"A plenty of wholesome food should be allowed her; time and space for",
"repentance given, time to think upon the error of her ways, and",
"instruction that would teach her how to do it.",
"",
"That worrisome night was to meet with one more \"thrilling adventure\"",
"before it passed away into the light of the following day.",
"",
"I lay, tossing from side to side, after I returned to my bed. Sleep was",
"out of the question. I lay, tossing thoughts about the circumstances",
"that surrounded me to and fro in my mind, trying to analyze, to",
"distinctness, the mixed up conclusions that arose from them.",
"",
"Another unearthly cry rung out on the air, and startled me from my",
"perplexed meditations. It was more like the shriek of an animal in",
"distress, than a human sound.",
"",
"Wail followed wail, in quick succession. Can it be a human being? I",
"asked myself, as I hurried on some clothing. It must be, there is",
"nothing else here that can make such a noise.",
"",
"I stopped to listen, as I went to search it out. It came from one",
"quarter, and then, from another. If it were made in one cell, it",
"possessed a wonderful power of ventriloquism.",
"",
"I remembered the hooting and whistling of the night before, and",
"immediately inferred that the same mischievous girls, who made the",
"disturbance in the evening, had set up this cry and echoed it around",
"from division to division, in order to make a night of it.",
"",
"Quick as the thought entered my mind, my patience gave way. I vowed, in",
"my heart, that I would have them punished if I could catch them. My own",
"aroused temper certainly suggested the punishment that I contemplated.",
"Even with the thought which suggested punishment arose the query--Is it",
"not a just indignation that I feel, and do they not deserve punishment",
"for willfully making this unreasonable disturbance? Is it my anger that",
"seeks revenge for the annoyance they are inflicting?",
"",
"Although half way down into the prison, I ran back to my room, and left",
"my slippers, in order to avoid the tap, tapping of the leather soles on",
"the walks, which would announce my approach to the culprits, and warn",
"them in season to avoid detection.",
"",
"Again I traversed flat after flat in my stockings. Quickly, and",
"noiselessly, I threaded the walks towards the spot from whence the sound",
"appeared to proceed. But when I reached it, all was silent there, and",
"the wail came shrieking around another corner.",
"",
"I grew more and more angry as chills crept up my limbs, and set my",
"teeth chattering. I raised my thinly clad feet from the cold stones only",
"to set them down in a still colder track--a practical test, it now",
"occurs to me, of the experience of the woman on the stones \"in",
"solitary,\"--but my determination to ferret out the offenders never",
"faltered.",
"",
"I was benumbed; but I persevered till I had traversed the five flats,",
"and listened at the door of nearly a hundred cells. The wails had grown",
"to howls, and filled the prison with their noise as the thunder fills",
"the air with its reverberations, but eluded my search.",
"",
"I gathered my shawl around me, and sat down by the stove to listen; and",
"determine my future course. When I became stationary, the sounds changed",
"their course, and instead of receding approached me. Nearer, and nearer",
"they came. In a moment they were issuing from the floor at my side. I",
"shook with a vague dread. Were those shrieking wails from some prisoner",
"confined in the dungeon vaults below the prison, insane or dying?",
"Involuntarily I looked down. There stood the cat, uttering piteous cries",
"on account of separation from her kittens in the kitchen, and pleading",
"to be let out to them.",
"",
"Quickly I ran over the stairs to get my keys, nor did I feel the chill",
"of the cold stone walks, as I ran back to appease the distress of the",
"mother cat by opening the way to her little ones.",
"",
"I did not regret that I lost the opportunity to execute the mentally",
"threatened punishment of my women.",

"                       THE MASTER AND THE RULES.",
"",
"",
"One morning, as I sat warming my feet by the prison stove, I heard a",
"slow, measured tread on the stone walk, like some one pacing off the",
"length of the building. When it came near to me I looked, to see the",
"Master stalking along in pompous dignity.",
"",
"There was what he probably supposed to be authority in his bearing.",
"",
"I arose and stood respectfully before him. I supposed he had commands of",
"some kind, for me, from his appearance.",
"",
"He went along without changing his gait, or turning his head, into the",
"kitchen.",
"",
"I really did not know what etiquette to observe on this state occasion;",
"but I slowly followed him. He marched round, looking over the place in",
"silent inspection; then came directly before me, and made a dead halt.",
"",
"He did not speak for a moment, and I, to relieve the embarrassment,",
"asked,--",
"",
"\"Does the place look to suit you?\"",
"",
"\"When it don't, I shall tell you,\" he answered gruffly.",
"",
"\"It is more pleasant to be told when we have pleased, than when we have",
"not.\"",
"",
"He made no reply to that remark; but said sternly,--",
"",
"\"You are not to read the Rules to the prisoners; you have nothing to do",
"with that.\"",
"",
"\"I have not read the Rules to the prisoners. I can find no rules to be",
"governed by myself, much more to read to them.\"",
"",
"\"If the prisoners do not obey you, you are to report them at once.\"",
"",
"\"I believe, according to the Rules and Regulations laid down by the",
"Board of Directors, that I am to admonish them once, and at the second",
"offense report them.\"",
"",
"He turned and stalked away, looking a little puzzled.",
"",
"At first I could not imagine to what he referred; but after stirring up",
"my memory, I recollected that I had mentioned, in reproving the women, a",
"day or two before, that they were breaking the Rules.",
"",
"I sat down and wrote the Master a note after this wise:--",
"",
"\"The women have a habit of talking as they march in and out of prison. I",
"am ordered to report them if they do it. I find in the Rules and",
"Regulations, given to the officers, by the Board of Overseers, on the",
"tenth page, that we are directed to 'admonish' the prisoners, for",
"misbehavior, and at the second offense report them. That was what I did",
"yesterday, however my proceedings may have been reported to you.\"",
"",
"In a few moments the Deputy made his appearance.",
"",
"\"Your explanation was just the thing. We have looked up the Rule, and",
"you are right. It is better to take each one as you catch her, rather",
"than take them all together.\"",
"",
"\"That gives me a chance to exercise still more mercy. Thank you!\"",
"",
"Thus ended my first interview with the Master, and the second was like",
"unto it.",
"",
"About a week after that the Receiving Matron came and told me that I was",
"to go to her wash-room, to oversee her women, while she went to put the",
"officers' rooms in order.",
"",
"I replied, \"I cannot attend to your work. I have more to do in my own",
"department than I have strength to accomplish.\"",
"",
"\"Mrs. Hardhack\"--that was the Shop Matron--\"said you were to do it.\"",
"",
"\"I am not employed by Mrs. Hardhack, nor do I take my orders from her.\"",
"",
"I was overburdened with work, and extremely tired. It appeared",
"unreasonable, to me, to crowd anything more upon me. I had not physical",
"strength to do any more than I was doing.",
"",
"The Matron turned from me in a fret, and left. I dropped upon a bench",
"and rested my head upon the table. From sheer fatigue the tears",
"started.",
"",
"In a few moments I heard the measured tread of the Master. I did not",
"raise my head till he had stood before me a moment or two. Then I looked",
"up. I did not pay him the respect to rise. He looked at me a moment, and",
"seemed to have some idea of my condition. He said gently, if anything",
"could be said gently by one so rough--",
"",
"\"I should like to have you go to the wash-room while the Matron is at",
"the officers' rooms. There is a gang of women at work there, and she",
"cannot leave them alone very well.\"",
"",
"His manner modified my feelings somewhat; but I had no idea of having",
"any more labor put upon me, and I said,--",
"",
"\"I find it very difficult to get through with the labor that I engaged",
"for, and it is impossible for me to have that of another put upon me.\"",
"",
"\"Just for to-day, as she has just come in.\"",
"",
"\"I will go for to-day, as a matter of favor; but I did not engage for",
"that work, and I don't wish her to feel that she can call upon me to",

"                             MRS. HARDHACK.",
"",
"",
"I had been in the prison but a few days when Ellen, one of my \"sweeps,\"",
"crept softly round to me, and whispered in my ear,--",
"",
"\"You must be careful what you say! Mrs. Hardhack has just been in on the",
"other side to listen. She creeps round like a cat, and you never know",
"when she's coming, and there's no knowing what she'll tell, and she'll",
"surely get you into trouble.\"",
"",
"\"Don't give yourself any uneasiness, she can't get me into trouble.\"",
"",
"\"Don't tell what I say; but she do pick a fuss with all the Matrons that",
"come here, and she tells on 'em, and reports 'em, and makes the Master",
"mad with 'em. And I jest see her creeping round in there now.\"",
"",
"\"You know that I am not obliged to stay here as you are, Ellen. If I am",
"made unhappy, I can leave at any time.\"",

"\"Thank you, Ellen. I am glad you want me to stay, because I think you",

"rules.\"",
"",
"\"I'm sure I'll do anything in the world to please ye.\"",

"I thought I would see if Ellen's information were correct, so I stepped",
"lightly around the corner to which she pointed. I was just in season to",
"see the back of Mrs. Hardhack's garments disappearing through the door.",
"",
"I was indifferent to such espionage personally. I could easily correct",
"any false impression which might be made of my conduct, as I had done in",
"the representation which had been made of my reading the Rules; but it",
"is extremely unpleasant to look upon such a character, as had been",
"developed, in one who must be an associate. The meanness and treachery",
"that were written upon it would stand out before me, whenever I saw her,",
"in spite of any good qualities that she might possess.",

"That woman had been in the institution a great many years, and had",
"become thoroughly imbued with the spirit of its rulers. If she went",
"round into the other departments to listen, I inferred that it must be",
"with the approval of the Master.",
"",
"If she carried him information acquired in that way, it must be",
"acceptable, or she would not continue it.",
"",
"It is difficult to understand why such management need be pursued in",
"this country. If the Master found a subordinate practicing against him,",
"he could dismiss her arbitrarily; but in so doing he would only dismiss",
"her out into the world to tell her own tale, he would argue. He could",
"make his own representation of the case to the Board of Directors, and",
"screen his own doings; but the Board are not the directors of public",
"opinion.",
"",
"A just, upright, and open management would secure the coöperation of",
"subordinates who are fit to hold a position in such an institution. That",
"such a course was not pursued, was because the disposition of the head",
"Manager led him in another direction, and the disposition of the",
"subordinate, Mrs. Hardhack, made her a fit agent to carry out his",
"peculiar views of the proper way to govern the institution.",
"",
"She did not stop at that, but tried many little experiments of her own",
"suggestion. Her long residence and knowledge of the place enabled her to",
"practice them very much to the annoyance of the other Matrons, and to",

"The women were her equals in detecting her ways, if they had not the",
"power to practice her stratagems.",

"called them.",
"",
"\"She's the artfulest huzzy that ever lived,\" said Ellen. \"She'll tell",
"the women when they leave the shop not to speak a word till they get out",
"of it, nor in the yard; but when they get into the prison they may talk",
"as much as they are a mind to. Don't ye see, that's to make you trouble.",
"You'll have to scold 'em, and get 'em locked up; and then, they'll hate",
"you, and plague you all they can.\"",
"",
"\"Don't be anxious, Ellen! After I have been here awhile the women will",
"understand me, and they won't be any more willing to plague me than you",
"are.\"",
"",
"\"That's true! but it will take longer because you don't see 'em so much",
"as you do us. And don't ye see, she'll tell 'em anything. She always",
"be's stirring up a fuss somewhere. The women all hates her.\"",
"",
"\"Never mind saying anything more, Ellen. I think I can manage her.\"",

"\"Don't let her know I've said anything! She'd surely pick up something",

"\"Anne O'Brien, stop!\"",
"",
"\"Well, ma'am, if she had treated you as she has me you would hate her.",

"That was the effect produced by solitary confinement, without",
"mitigation, as I heard it talked universally among the prisoners. Does",
"it conduce to reformation?",

"At the time this occurred, I thought the prisoners had exaggerated in",
"their statements about Mrs. Hardhack; but in a few days they were",
"confirmed by her own conduct.",

"",
"That remark of mine hit wide of the mark. Instead of touching her",
"compassion it roused the spirit of mischief.",
"",
"She was on duty that night in prison, and, restless as the renowned",
"adventurer who went to and fro in the earth seeking whom he might",
"devour, she went on a search through the cells of the first division",
"where my kitchen women lodged.",
"",
"The Deputy had ordered me to supply the women, on that division, with",
"all the blankets they wanted, because they worked in the kitchens where",
"it was hot and the air full of steam. And being the lowest tier of",
"cells, they were colder than the others.",
"",
"I had done as he directed me, so that some of them had four or five.",
"Allen, my steam woman, an old woman of nearly sixty, had six.",

"",
"\"Here are your women with six blankets, and the rule is that they shall",
"have only two. A double one and a single one.\"",
"",
"I was in no wise accountable to her, and did not think it necessary to",
"answer. I stood and looked at her. She went on,--",
"",
"\"You have no right to give your women more than the rest have. You have",
"no right to give out blankets in that way, and the Master will know it",
"directly. Here are your women with six blankets, and my shop women with",

"mine.\"",
"",
"When she had exhausted herself, I said, quietly, but loud enough for",
"them all to hear,--",
"",
"\"Your shop women are just as well treated as my kitchen women. Some of",
"the old ones have five or six blankets--they all have as many as they",
"wish for. I have been to the doors, and asked every one of them if they",
"wished for more. And now if any woman wants another blanket, speak! and",
"she shall have it. You may be assured, every one of you, that you shall",
"have every comfort, from me, that I am allowed to give you.\"",
"",
"No one spoke. That time Mrs. Hardhack failed to stir up jealousy on the",
"part of the shop women towards me; or create disturbance in the prison.",
"",
"\"I shall have it my own way about the blankets to-night,\" she said, and",
"locked them in a black cell.",
"",
"I did not like to come in contact with her, so I went for the Deputy, to",
"settle the matter. He was out. I asked for the Master. I was told that I",
"could not see him. He was indisposed. I could not get access to him,",

"number was a woman by the name of Callahan.",

"\"What was my bed taken out for?\"",
"",
"\"I didn't know that it was out.\"",
"",
"She looked steadily at me for a moment; then, lowered her voice, and",
"asked,--",
"",
"\"Do you mean to say that you didn't know that my bed was out?\"",
"",
"\"Yes, Callahan, I meant to say that I did not know your bed was taken",
"out. Perhaps you are mistaken, it may not be out.\"",
"",
"\"O, yes, it is out; I saw the naked bars.\"",
"",
"\"Come, Callahan, go along like a good woman! Go to your room first, and",
"see, before you ask why it is done.\"",
"",
"She went into her room. The other women were in theirs. I called,--",
"",
"\"Second Division!\"",
"",
"All of the rest shut their doors.",
"",
"\"Shut your door, Callahan!\" I called pleasantly.",
"",
"\"No, ma'am, I will not. I don't mean anything against you; but I will",
"not shut my door, nor sleep on the bars. Do you know who reported me,",
"and what my bed is taken out for?\"",
"",
"\"No, I do not.\"",
"",
"I was obliged to leave her standing in her door, and go round to the",
"other side of the prison to see the other prisoners slid in.",

"\"Callahan, stop!\" I ran round and called.",
"",
"Neither of the Shop Matrons appeared, and I was told that it was because",
"they were afraid of Callahan's violence.",
"",
"\"No, I won't stop! I'll do something to make them lock me up. I won't",
"sleep on the bars. It was Hardhack that reported me. I wish I'd struck",
"her down!\"",
"",
"\"No! no! it was Thingsly,\" said a voice that I did not know.",
"",
"\"Hardhack made the balls if Thingsly fried 'em. She's at the bottom of",
"all the deviltry there is done here.\"",
"",
"Then she commenced a tirade of vituperations and oaths that made my ears",
"tingle.",
"",
"In a few moments the Deputy made his appearance.",
"",
"\"Your No. 1 key,\" he said to me, and proceeded to Callahan's room.",
"",
"I got it; and then followed him.",
"",
"\"Now, Mr. Deputy,\" she said to him, when he went up to her; \"you know I",
"won't sleep on the bars. You might as well lock me up first as last, if",
"you are going to punish me. But you ought to tell me what it's for. I",
"haven't done anything but speak in the walk, and all of 'em do that.\"",
"",
"The Deputy made no reply; but I saw that he had buttoned up his coat as",
"though he expected violence. She went peaceably to her solitary cell,",
"however; but all of the way she begged the Deputy to tell her what he",
"was locking her up for.",
"",
"When she saw me standing by the Deputy, she asked me where Hardhack and",
"Thingsly were.",
"",
"\"I don't know; they haven't been in the prison to-night.\"",
"",
"\"They're afraid to come; but I wouldn't hurt the poor little lambs. They",

"\"Shall I give her her bread and water to-night?\" I asked the Deputy, as",
"he turned to leave.",
"",
"\"Yes.\"",
"",
"I knew the water would be grateful to the poor thing.",
"",
"I wished to ask the Deputy if Callahan had told the truth; but my own",
"consciousness told me that she had. I had learned to esteem the man, and",
"I could not bear to hear him say that he was accessory to such",
"injustice, although I knew that it was his duty as a subordinate officer",
"to do as he had done.",
"",
"I could not help questioning, Ought not the girl to be told what she is",
"punished for? Has she been \"admonished?\" The poor thing had no redress",
"for such injustice.",
"",
"That was the point that she, too, was revolving in her mind. When I gave",
"her the bread and water, she said to me,--",
"",
"\"Look here, now, don't you think they ought to tell me what I am",
"punished for?\"",
"",
"\"You must not ask me such questions. It isn't for me to sit in judgment",
"upon what the Master does.\"",
"",
"She was intent on finding out my opinions, so she put her questions in a",
"different way.",
"",
"\"If you reported me, wouldn't you tell me what it was for?\"",
"",
"\"Certainly! I should probably give you a good scolding before I had you",
"punished.\"",
"",
"\"If you was going to punish me just as you were a mind to, for speaking",
"on the walk, would you shut me up here two days and two nights for it?\"",
"",
"\"Perhaps not; but how do you know that you are to stay here two days and",
"two nights?\"",
"",
"\"Because they are never shut up for any shorter time.\"",
"",
"\"O'Brien and McMullins were only in for one day and a night.\"",
"",
"\"That was because you begged 'em off. But nobody'll beg me off. Say!",
"would you shut me up here for speaking on the walk?\"",
"",
"\"Perhaps not; but you knew the rule, and disobeyed,--it is for",
"disobedience that you are punished.\"",
"",
"\"Ever so many of them talked,--they all talk; but none of 'em got",
"punished but me. They've got a spite against me,--is that right.\"",
"",
"\"Perhaps that is your jealousy, Callahan.\"",
"",
"\"No, it isn't. Four of us were talking together. If Thingsly saw one,",
"she saw the whole of us.\"",
"",
"\"Perhaps it isn't for that you are punished.\"",
"",
"\"Won't you find out? Won't you ask Hardhack?\"",
"",
"\"No, I don't wish to.\"",
"",
"\"Are you afraid of her?\"",
"",
"\"No!\"",
"",
"\"Do you like that woman?\"",
"",
"\"She is nothing to me. But if I were to ask her a question, about what",
"does not concern me, I might not get a civil answer.\"",
"",
"I was fast arriving to the conclusion that it would be impossible for me",
"to assist in carrying out such a system of government.",
"",
"The next day I spoke to the Deputy about letting her out. He shook his",
"head.",
"",
"\"If she was one of your women, and you had the care of her, I might.\"",
"",
"When the two days were expired, he sent me round word to let Callahan",
"out at six o'clock. With my watch in my hand I did not defer it a moment",
"later. As I was waiting upon her to her room, I asked her,--",
"",
"\"Why had you rather go into solitary than sleep on the bars?\"",
"",
"\"If I sleep on the bars, I lose just as much time, and have to work all",
"the next day. If I can't have my bed to sleep in, I won't work for 'em.\"",
"",
"\"I shouldn't think there would be much rest in solitary.\"",
"",
"\"There ain't; but I don't earn any money for them either.\"",
"",
"There was retaliation with calculation.",
"",
"\"Callahan, I turned the key on you in solitary, and kept you there,--why",
"are you not angry with me?\"",
"",
"\"You didn't do it out of spite--you never did me any wrong. If they only",
"punished me when I deserved it, I shouldn't be mad.\"",
"",
"I did not know how to reprove the woman. \"Callahan, be as good a woman",
"in the shop as you are with me.\"",

"bake-house, and sent in to us to be carved and served.",
"",
"The gravy was to be made in the kitchen, and the potatoes steamed: the",
"meat and potatoes put into the pans, and the gravy poured over them.",
"",
"To get that meat to its right destination required sharp care on my",
"part. There were extra women sent in from the wash-room to help on",
"Sunday. They, with my own, were possessed with a disposition to get",
"possession of the greater part of that rarity.",
"",
"They got up all sorts of inventions to get me out of the room, while it",
"was being sliced, in order to secrete a part of it for their own use,",
"the next day, and for that of their favorites among the prisoners.",
"",
"At first they had been able to impose upon my ignorance, but at this",
"time I had learned just how much two hundred and eighty pounds of meat",
"would divide to about four hundred people. I had learned their \"tricks",
"and their manners\" also, so that it had become impossible for them to",
"draw me from my object, which was, to see it equally divided.",
"",
"\"An' sure ma'am,\" said Bridget O'Halloran; \"we're wanting the pails from",
"the hospital.\"",
"",
"In order to get the pails I must go to the outside door, blow my whistle",
"to call a runner, wait till he came, and then order my pails. The hint",
"was just in season. Allen had taken the first piece on her fork to",
"commence carving. I said to her,--",
"",
"\"Don't cut that meat till I come back, not one slice.\"",
"",
"I then ordered in the pails, and bread--everything that would be wanted",
"before dinner, and took my station at the table with the determination",
"not to be drawn away from it upon any pretense.",
"",
"The smell of the meat to the poor, half-fed things was very savory, and",
"they came around picking up the bits which fell off while it was being",
"carved.",
"",
"\"Please ma'am, give me a bone,--just the least bit of bone!\" was the cry",
"perpetually in my ears. And the bones I was forced to give to their",
"importunity as fast as they were freed from the meat.",
"",
"To keep their fingers from that meat was like fighting eagles from a",
"dead carcass.",
"",
"Bridget O'Halloran's ways were suspicious. I thought she had eluded my",
"vigilance, and secreted some of it in spite of me. I kept watch of her",
"motions for the rest of the day.",
"",
"I noticed that she visited the shed very frequently. If I wanted her I",
"was continually obliged to send for her. At last I thought I would go",
"myself and see what attraction that old shed had become so suddenly",
"possessed of.",
"",
"When I discovered her she was stooping down in the middle of the",
"building without any apparent object in view.",
"",
"\"Bridget--I want you in the kitchen at this moment!\"",
"",
"She was fumbling about her stocking. I stood looking at her while she",
"was apparently arranging it.",
"",
"\"What is the matter with your stocking, Bridget?\"",
"",
"\"Nothing, ma'am!\"",
"",
"She colored, was confused, and started with the top of it in her hand. I",
"let her pass on before me so as to get a better prospect of what was",
"going on.",
"",
"From the glimpse that I got of her leg I thought she had been following",
"the fashion--in adopting false calves. In hurrying her I had spoiled the",
"proper adjustment of them, and they had slipped to her ankles. I",
"intended to examine into the case when I reached the kitchen; but an",
"explanation came by way of accident.",
"",
"In order to make more speed, as I hurried her on before me, she let go",
"the top of her stocking, the weight of what was in it brought it down",
"over her shoe, and out fell two or three slices of meat. The cause of",
"her clumsiness in moving was explained, also of her frequent absences.",
"She had slily slipped away slice after slice, one at a time, and gone",
"into the shed to secrete them in that safe place.",
"",
"Under my eyes, as I stood looking at that meat, she had done it.",
"",
"\"Stop! pick up your meat, Bridget!\"",
"",
"\"It's no matter, ma'am!\"",
"",
"Her face was ablaze with disappointment and smothered anger, and tears",
"filled her eyes.",
"",
"\"Stop, and pick up that meat!\"",
"",
"She did so.",
"",
"\"Now look me in the face!\"",
"",
"That was a hard command for her to fulfill; but she looked up at me.",
"",
"\"Caught in the act of stealing! You do not intend to treat me any",
"better than you do any one else?\"",
"",
"\"I did not mean it against you,--indeed I didn't!\"",
"",
"\"Every rule that you disobey is something done against me.\"",
"",
"\"I suppose you will report me; but I was awful hungry.\"",
"",
"\"The rest of the prisoners are awful hungry; you are no worse off than",
"they when you share equally with them; but if you rob them, in order to",
"help yourself to more than they have, you make them worse off.\"",
"",
"\"I did not think of that. I work hard, and I earn a good living, and I",
"mean to get it if I could. It's a shame for me to go hungry when I work",
"so hard.\"",
"",
"\"If you steal food here, Bridget, you steal it from your",
"fellow-prisoners, not from the institution. There is just so much",
"allowed for you all, and the rest won't get any more, in any way, if you",
"take it from them. They must go without if you have it; and they work",
"just as hard as you, and get no more for it.\"",
"",
"\"It makes me awful mad to think I work so hard, and don't get any pay",
"for it.\"",
"",
"\"Then you ought not to come here. You have been here before, and you",
"knew just how it was before you did the wrong which brought you here.",
"You were sent here to work hard, for nothing, for a punishment.\"",
"",
"\"Others do worse than I, and they don't come here. If those that put me",
"here had their dues they'd be here too!\"",
"",
"That was the continual rejoinder.",
"",
"\"May be; but how are you going to help that? You will have about as much",
"as you can do to attend to your own case. Only think of what you have",
"been doing; robbing another person as badly off as you are. You ought to",
"have pity on each other, if no one else has pity on you! You ought to",
"respect the rights of your fellow-prisoners,--they have done you no",
"harm!\"",
"",
"\"I will; but I was so hungry and the meat smelt so good; and I did not",
"think of them. If you worked as I do, and was real hungry, and saw the",
"meat, wouldn't you take it?\"",
"",
"\"I don't know, Bridget; I have not had the temptation.\"",
"",
"The word temptation sounded out from the other words that I had been",
"using, fearfully loud when I pronounced it. A nice slice of roast beef",
"was a strong temptation to those hungry women. They were allowed enough",
"to tantalize but not to satisfy them.",
"",
"By being kept without enough to satisfy their hunger they were led into",
"sin, if it be a sin for them to help themselves to more than their",
"share. They were led to disobey the rules, which involved punishment if",
"they were detected. It would certainly undermine their health to work so",
"many hours as they were obliged to without a suitable amount of food to",
"produce recuperation.",
"",
"\"Are you hungry enough to eat that meat after it has been in your",
"stocking, and on this floor?\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am; it ain't hurt it any. I'll eat it if you'll give it to me.\"",
"",
"\"Eat it!\"",
"",
"She brushed the dust off it with her hand, tore it apart with her",
"fingers, and put it in her mouth.",
"",
"\"Bridget, don't ever take any more, and secrete it without my",
"knowledge.\"",
"",
"\"No, ma'am; and you wont report me now.\"",
"",
"\"I gave you the meat. How can I report you?\"",
"",
"\"Thank you!\"",
"",
"\"If you are ever so hungry, don't you put any away for yourself without",
"asking me!\"",
"",
"\"No, ma'am!\"",
"",
"Perhaps she will not. The fear of punishment, in a solitary cell, had",
"not deterred her from taking the meat. Perhaps pity for her",
"fellow-prisoners would not; nor the desire to please me.",
"",
"That evening I heard the Matrons discussing the music by the quartette",
"choir in the chapel of the prison.",
"",
"\"You have a hired choir?\" I asked.",
"",
"\"Yes, and an organ?\"",
"",

"After the kitchen was put in order, that Sunday afternoon, I gathered",
"the women around me, and read a story to them, from a religious",
"newspaper.",
"",
"I also read them one of the Saviour's parables. Then, I talked with them",
"so as to find out what ideas they entertained of themselves, and the",
"lives they had led.",
"",
"\"What are you in here for, Sarah?\" I asked of a smart, bright, active",
"woman. As she was among convicts she was called bold; but if she were",
"working outside she would be called a smart, capable woman. If any",
"notice were taken of her ways she would be just remarked as independent.",
"",
"\"For shoplifting, ma'am;\" and with a toss of her head, that was intended",
"to ward off reproof, she added, \"When I go out of here I will do just so",

"",
"\"Then you will get detected, and brought back again.\"",

"\"No, ma'am! I'll look out for that.\"",
"",
"\"You cannot; you may be sure your sin will find you out. If you break",

"may be in some other way.\"",

"",
"\"That's my case,\" said Bridget. \"The Lord knows just how poor we are,",
"and how hard it is for us to get along; and He knows how the rich folks",
"crowds on us, and He pities us. And He knows how they lie, and cheat,",
"and steal from each other,--and He won't punish us any more nor He does",
"them.\"",
"",
"\"It will make no difference to you what they do to each other, or what",
"He does to them. You will not have to answer for their misconduct, nor",
"be punished for it. You will only suffer for the commands which you",

"\"We can't help it,\" said the ever ready O'Brien. \"I'd like to pay them",
"back what they've done to me. Don't you suppose we've got human",
"feelings? Only think what that miserable Hardhack has made me suffer in",
"solitary. Wouldn't I make her suffer back again? I'd beat her till she",
"couldn't stand, the first time I meet her, if it wasn't for getting",
"another sentence. One girl did give her an awful pommeling, and",
"scratched her face; and she got another six months for it.\"",
"",
"\"O Annie, that is a bad temper!\" but I thought I would study her still",
"further. \"I don't see why just the idea of being punished should make",
"you so angry. I had you punished. What would tempt you to strike me?\"",
"",
"\"Nothing on earth, ma'am! I would stand between you and a blow if it",
"broke my head.\"",
"",
"\"But I had you locked in solitary.\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am, and you was sorry for it, and I deserved it. But when they",
"lock me up for nothing it makes me mad.\"",
"",
"\"Who is to be judge of when you deserve it? It would not do to leave it",
"to you. You would never think you deserved it.\"",
"",
"\"You are mistaken there, ma'am. Didn't I tell you to report me when I",
"was locked up? Didn't I say that I deserved it? You might have some of",
"us locked up every day, if you were a mind to; but it wouldn't make us a",
"bit better.\"",

"\"It would make me very unhappy to do that. It would make me sick at",
"heart to see you such bad women as that.\"",
"",
"\"We know it, and that keeps us from a great many things. But you might,",
"for what we do, if you had a mind to, just to show your authority. You",
"don't get mad, and we don't. You try to make us better, and we wouldn't",
"any of us be mean enough to do wrong on purpose.\"",
"",
"\"I could not have you punished when I see that you are trying to do",
"right. It is when you do wrong, and are determined to do wrong, that I",
"shall have you punished. I see that you are improving in governing your",
"temper, Annie. You don't get angry so easily as you used to, and you",
"don't give way to it when you are angry, as you did two or three weeks",
"ago.\"",
"",
"\"I don't think I do; but I should if you got mad and scolded me. If I do",
"anything wrong, you turn round so calm, and talk to me so, it makes me",
"ashamed; and I think of it when I want to do it again, and it keeps me",
"from it, because I know you'd make me ashamed again. You have the upper",
"hands of me. When I was in the shop, Hardhack would get mad and scold",
"me, and that would make me mad, and I would sauce her; and then I got",
"punished. If she hadn't got mad first I shouldn't.\"",
"",
"It occurred to me that the officers of the institution would do well to",
"study the rule of the Board which directs that \"no irritating language\"",

"additional quality, the oversight which compelled it to be carried out.",
"",
"\"If I were to get angry and scold I could hardly have confidence to",

"place.\"",
"",
"\"It wasn't a crime, ma'am. I'm sure I only took from the rich. I never",
"lifted from any but the big stores where they lie and steal and make",
"fortunes. I never went into any of the little small places, where they",
"are trying hard for a living. I wouldn't be guilty of such a mean",
"thing.\"",
"",
"\"Honor among thieves,\" says the old proverb.",
"",
"\"But it did not belong to you, without regard to the way they got it.",
"You gave nothing in return for it.\"",
"",
"\"It did not belong to them, either. It belonged to me as much as it did",
"to them. It would be hard telling who the right owner is. I thought I",
"might as well have my share.\"",
"",
"\"I do not see that you had any share in it. You were taking that for",
"which you made no return to any one, and that was stealing.\"",
"",
"\"If it had belonged to them it would be stealing. They take it, and",
"dress their children up, and make a great show on it. My children are as",
"good as theirs. Don't you suppose I want them drest up as nice when they",
"go to school, and look like other children? I can't earn the things if I",
"work ever so hard, so I lift from those that cheat out of others.\"",
"",
"\"Do you see what examples you are setting them? You are bringing them up",
"to be thieves; and instead of the fine things which you covet for them,",
"they will be drest in the same uniform that you are.\"",
"",
"\"Never, ma'am; never! my children shall never be thieves!\"",
"",
"\"But they will do as you do.\"",
"",
"\"No, ma'am, they will not do as I do. They shall not. They go to",
"day-school, and to Sunday-school, and say their prayers at night. They",
"will never do as their mother does!\"",
"",
"In saying that she choked down the sobs that rose in her throat, and",
"brushed off the tears that were gathered in her eyes, just ready to run",
"over the hardy old cheeks.",
"",
"\"If they grow up to think differently from what you do,--to look upon",
"the sin of stealing as it really is,--they will be greatly grieved that",
"you have committed such acts. They will be ashamed of the clothes you",
"have stolen for them. Every time they look at them they will think, my",
"mother stole this dress. They will think everybody knows that she stole",
"it. They will be ashamed to look any one in the face. The other children",
"will taunt them with it, and they will be miserable, and they will turn",
"it back upon you. They will blush for their mother; then, how can they",
"respect or love her!\"",
"",
"If there were a tender spot in that mother's heart I meant to probe it,",
"and I succeeded. She covered her face with her hands, and her chest",
"heaved. The big tears made their way through her fingers. She was",
"determined to brave it out. In a very few moments she mastered her",
"emotions, and answered me,--",
"",
"\"They don't know what I do, and they never shall know it.\"",

"\"Don't they know where you are now?\"",
"",
"\"No, ma'am!\"",
"",
"\"Where do they think you are?\"",
"",
"\"Gone a journey.\"",
"",
"\"You may deceive them that way for a time; but you are only adding sin",
"to sin. God says 'the iniquities of the parents shall be visited upon",
"the children.' You may be sure that they will know it in the end. It was",

"you have done, and where your sin has brought you.\"",
"",
"\"I didn't come here in my own name.\"",

"Talking is one thing, and living another. My children shall look as well",
"as the best of them they go with.\"",
"",
"That one idea had been ground into her mind by the force of her",
"associations--the one idea of dress. It was in those above, around,",
"below her. She had adopted it unconsciously, irresistibly.",
"",
"The mother's love and pride were in that woman's heart in all their",
"strength, and they had been developed by the circumstances around her.",
"She did not care what she suffered if they could only be supplied with",
"the good things which she valued because she saw the whole world setting",
"the high price upon them. Body and soul might be the sacrifice; no",
"matter, so she obtained them. Into what a strangely perverted channel",
"had that mother's love run. Was that noblest, best of woman's instincts",
"to destroy that woman's human life, and ruin her soul? God knows! He",
"also knows how much of her sin rests upon those who profess to be",
"following after better things; but have set her the example to make the",
"obtaining of dress the business of her life; and placed the temptation",

"",
"How hollow those words sounded to me as they came from my lips. How easy",
"it is to preach sound doctrine. How hard to make an impression, with it,",
"upon minds and hearts established in their own opinions of right and",
"wrong, and persistent in the determination to follow the wrong! If I",
"could have had that woman under my influence a year, I might have led",
"her into different views and ways. She was not wholly hardened, as her",
"tears showed.",
"",
"\"God did intend that I should have it, and that was His way of giving it",

"I'm willing to leave it to Him. I don't believe He will judge me any",
"harder than He will those I took it from.\"",
"",
"She fell back again upon what others do. I had made no progress in",

"yours. You could have restrained him through the laws that punish",

"\"I did not think of that.\"",

"it again.\"",
"",
"\"No, ma'am, I don't think I shall. This is harder than working for a",
"living outside, besides the rough handling we get. A poor living at",
"that, and poorer clothes. And you officers don't fare much better. You",

"",
"\"But we are not prisoners; we can go if we like.\"",

"\"What do you stay here for; you don't seem fit for such work, and you",
"might earn a great deal more outside, and not work so hard?\"",

"I shrank away from the task in loathing. Low, narrow, confined, they",
"were like the cages of wild animals.",
"",
"The human odor of the occupants had penetrated the walls and made the",

"I put my head within the door, the bugs were crawling along the walls,",

"up the filthy sight, if she could not cleanse the dirt away.",
"",
"If the sight is so revolting, what must it be to sleep among them, to be",
"lodged with, and fed upon by them. I worked up my feelings of pity for",
"the poor prisoners till my disgust was partially overcome.",
"",
"The rats and mice can come in at the open doors, and there is no",
"obstacle to such ingress of bed-bugs. Indeed such armies of them as I",
"beheld could hardly have made their entrance in any other way. There",
"they were in swarms, and had planted their colonies upon the solid brick",

"",
"My indignation was aroused against those who had charge of this place,",
"and who, in their neglect, had allowed these dens for the confinement of",
"human beings to become breeding nests of vermin. That indignation gave",
"me courage and energy for my task. I set one of my sweeps to the work of",
"slaughter. I stood by and directed the cleansing with shivers of",
"disgust creeping along my flesh, and thrills of indignation stirring my",
"heart.",
"",
"When the Deputy came round, I gave vent to my feelings in a side-thrust",
"of sarcasm. I stated to him the condition in which I found the cells,",

"\"Did these bed-bugs get a sentence here for life; or did they come, a",
"special beneficence to the prisoners, by an order approved by the",

"\"Some poor old cripple, I suppose, who would be an additional care. It",

"\"I am not.\"",
"",
"\"Just let me tell you what an able-bodied corps I have in the kitchen.",
"Old Allen, the steam woman, has a broken wrist. The cook is lame in one",
"of her hips. One of the sink women has fits; the women say, the other is",
"a 'poor weak thing.' One of the slide women is in that condition which",
"some women, of the class that are here, find themselves without a lord,",
"and always demands consideration. Another has just got up from her",

"\"I will see what I can do for you; but I'm sure the Master will not be",
"willing to spare you one of his shop hands.\"",
"",
"To get a large amount of contract work done, and show the figures that",
"were received for it, was the Master's way of recommending himself to",
"the Board of Directors; and it was what enabled him to keep his place.",
"",
"It must be an apparent fact to the most shallow comprehension, that",
"dollars and cents are essential to the welfare of humanity; but there",
"are various ways of calculating their benefit.",
"",
"The \"almighty dollar\" enlarges and increases in value, as it is",
"contemplated, and its advantages dwelt upon. In the same ratio does an",
"appreciation of human suffering decrease as it becomes familiar to the",
"observation. The Master had evidently been through the mental process in",
"both directions. The dollar had grown till it covered the whole surface",
"of human life; the suffering had diminished till it became a mere speck",
"in the distant view which he took of it.",
"",
"\"Let me have Callahan?\" I proposed.",
"",
"\"I don't believe it would be best,\" and he shook his head wisely. \"You",
"would get along with her, and she would make you no trouble; but it",
"wouldn't be a week before she would be in a broil with the other women,",
"and I should be obliged to lock her up.\"",
"",
"\"When she was in here before, she was in the kitchen four months,",
"without being locked up, wasn't she? She gets locked up where she is",
"now.\"",
"",
"He saw that I was informed upon Callahan's past history. She did a great",
"deal of work in the shop; the Master would not be willing to spare her.",
"He knew that to transfer her to the kitchen would be to interfere with",
"Mrs. Hardhack's plan of breaking her temper, and she would resist her",
"removal. His influence was not strong enough to overcome that of the two",
"combined. He shook his head,--",
"",
"\"I'm afraid I cannot, and I do not think it would be best.\" He",
"understood how to make his refusal palatable. \"I think you are getting",
"along well. I have been intending to tell you that I am satisfied with",
"your management. The kitchen is clean and quiet; and the meals are",
"prompt, much more so than they were for a long time before you came.",
"They are well cooked, too.\"",
"",
"\"Thank you! but my women are worked beyond endurance. It makes my heart",
"ache to see those poor cripples lifting out tubs of swill that two men",
"could scarce handle; and bucketful after bucketful of that large, heavy",
"coal from the cellar, with all of their other lifting and scrubbing.\"",
"",
"\"I'll see what can I do about sending you another woman. Do the best you",
"can!\"",
"",
"\"I will certainly do that.\"",

"",
"\"The Deputy wouldn't be hard on us, if he could help it.\"",
"",
"I did the best I could. I told them I was sorry to make them work so",
"hard; but I could not help it. I asked them to do things, when I could",
"possibly do it, rather than give a command.",
"",
"When I had time I gave them a reason, for an order, and however tired",
"they might be, that was sure to secure ready and prompt acquiescence.",
"",
"\"You must get on more steam as quick as you can, because we are a little",
"behind time with our dinner,\" was sure to set Allen's fire going at",
"once.",
"",
"If I came in, and found them sitting down, idly gossiping away the time",
"before their work was done, I had only to say,--",
"",
"\"Now, girls, start round, and get your work done; then, you can sit down",
"and talk. A clean room is so much pleasanter than a dirty one to me, and",
"I want my place to look the nicest of any one in the institution, and",
"you wish me to have the credit of its being so. You like to have all of",
"the visitors taken in to see the kitchen because it looks so nice.\"",
"",
"They would put the work about very quickly. Scrub and dust, and make the",
"old kitchen shine like a new one in a twinkling.",
"",
"They were keen enough to fathom character, and took no advantage of my",
"manner. They were conciliated; but did not lose the restraint of",
"authority. They knew it was there, and could be used if necessary.",
"",
"They never gave me impertinence; nor refused to obey when an order came",
"directly from me.",
"",
"That inspection day was a literal washing of the great Master's feet;",
"not with my tears of penitence, but with the bitter remnants of pride",
"and anger subdued to patience? My work was even more humiliating. It was",
"that of the dogs, at the temple gate, cleansing the sores of the vagrant",
"Lazarus.",
"",
"The prisoners were allowed the condiments of salt, pepper, and vinegar.",
"Their boxes and bottles were filled every Thursday. That was to last",
"till the next Thursday. If they were wasted, or extravagantly used, they",
"were obliged to go without till the replenishing day came. To attend to",
"that was one of the duties of the chambermaids.",
"",
"I was obliged to look after it or they would scatter and waste their",
"allowance, and then play off on me. They would call to me,--",
"",
"\"I want salt; there was none put in my box.\"",
"",
"That would be done from pure mischief, to get the sweeps a scolding.",
"But I gave them little chance to carry out their mischief in that way. I",
"had the answer ready,--",
"",
"\"It was put there. I have been in every room to-day and saw it there. If",
"it is gone you have wasted it, and must go without.\"",
"",
"\"I haven't wasted it.\"",
"",
"\"Wasn't it your pepper and salt that was strewed on the shop-floor",
"to-day?\"",
"",
"That hint that I was after them, and knew what they were about, was",
"sufficient. There were no more complaints made.",
"",
"Every woman was obliged to make, and tie up, her own bed. The prison",
"women swept the rooms every morning. That gave them an opportunity to",
"secrete many a nice bit for their friends. Indeed my sweeps ran a",
"regular underground bakery express from the Masters kitchen, and also",
"from the prisoners'.",
"",
"Many a nice biscuit and slice of cake went from the range to the cells,",
"and bread from my table was provided against mush morning, and",
"brown-bread breakfasts.",
"",
"Onions were a favorite vegetable, but their telltale odor enabled me to",
"detect them easily.",
"",
"One evening, I passed a cell where they gave out unmistakable evidence",
"of their presence. I called to one of the sweeps,--",
"",
"\"Ellen, the gardener has made a mistake! He has put the onions, for the",
"soup to-morrow, in one of those cells. Won't you take them out, and put",
"them in the cellar. If one of the other Matrons, or the Deputy, were to",
"come in, they would smell them as plainly as I do, and they might think",
"you put them there for some one to eat privately, and get you reported.\"",
"",
"That hint was sufficient; I never smelt onions in the cells again.",
"",
"The officers professed to take no report from one prisoner against",
"another; but when they got angry with a prisoner, and wished to remove",
"her from their department, they did not scruple to avail themselves of",
"information obtained in that way. Berry, my white-washer, was an apt",
"agent. Sly, artful, and treacherous, she pretended sympathy, and got",
"possession of knowledge which was Mrs. Hardhack's principal clew to find",
"out what was going on in the kitchen and prison.",
"",
"The other women understood, and avoided her. That made her angry, and",
"the more watchful and treacherous.",
"",
"One day she found a biscuit from the officers' table in a cell. She",
"reasoned that Flannagan must have put it there, because Flannagan and",
"the girl in whose cell she found it were great friends. That morning the",
"Housekeeper had been fretted with Flannagan, and Berry had got wind of",
"it. Here was the opportunity to exercise her vocation. She slipped the",
"biscuit under her apron, took it into the officers' kitchen, and showed",
"it to the Housekeeper.",
"",
"Flannagan must have done it, because she had given offense in the",
"morning; and she was forthwith dismissed to the shop.",
"",
"A woman who came in a few days before, on a long sentence, had been",

"I thought, as I went to look up something for her to take to the poor",

"\"Bring a slice of bread, and quart of coffee to go with it.\"",

"Handing it to Mrs. Hardhack, I dispatched her as quickly as possible. I",
"was glad when she departed. Her visits to the kitchen were very",
"disagreeable. She always managed to use the \"irritating language,\"",
"forbidden by the Board in their \"Rules and Regulations,\" which stirred",
"up the angry feelings of my women, and it took time and argument to get",
"them settled down into calmness and quiet again.",
"",
"\"If it hadn't been for you, I should have been in solitary again,\" said",
"O'Brien, after she left. \"How I hate that woman!\"",
"",
"\"And so do I, and so do I!\" was echoed round the room.",

"\"If you hate such ways never copy them!\"",
"",
"\"What's the use in scolding us! She knows we can't help the victuals. If",

"\"Why didn't the women bring over their clothes?\"",
"",
"\"What clothes?\"",

"I was wide awake--thoroughly aroused when that story was completed.",

"\"Maggie Murray, do you mean to say that you saw the Master pull Ida",

"",
"I asked myself if it were possible that that man would dare to abuse the",

"secrecy upon which our prisons are managed is just calculated to screen",
"such conduct, and to induce the practice of it, if there be a tendency,",
"in the disposition of the man who has charge, to do it. If the testimony",

"If prisoners are entirely unworthy of trust, how does it happen that",

"prison, has charge there, and the unlimited confidence of the Board?",
"",
"I noticed, in making out the report of inmates, that there were not so",
"many women as men in prison. There was satisfaction in obtaining that",
"fact, because I had entertained the idea that women were more frequently",
"punished for their offenses than men.",
"",
"It was a mistake, except in the one crime of licentiousness. In that man",
"goes comparatively free, and woman is the only sufferer in what is, to",
"say the least, their mutual sin. I say, almost every woman will say, and",
"with truth, for the sin that man leads her into.",
"",
"Woman does not seek man, in that way, in the first instance. He draws",
"her into the sin, and when she becomes abandoned, and the Penitentiary",
"brings her up, she is no worse than he. She becomes a night-walker, and",
"suffers for her violation of law. He is a night-walker also, as",
"miserable and degraded a man as she is woman; but who prosecutes him,",
"and gives him a sentence in the House of Correction! He continues a",
"night-walker unmolested while she suffers for her sin.",
"",
"He walks into the parlors of the intellectually cultivated, and socially",
"refined,--I was about to say virtuous woman. There can be little virtue",
"in such shaky morality. I can only say of the chaste woman, and she",
"takes the hand of the night-walker, and greets him cordially, and makes",
"him welcome, especially if he be rich,--the hand that leads her fellow",
"woman to her social ruin if not to her eternal death.",
"",
"If woman were to help make the laws, could she remedy this state of",
"things,--would she? Would she take her husband, father, brother from his",
"home to the Penitentiary? She must do that, in order to rid society of",
"the pest of night-walking. She may do that now if she will. The law",
"gives her the opportunity. Instead of lavishing her courtesies, as she",
"now does, upon the male offender, she might extend her charity in kindly",
"assistance to his victim, if she were disposed to do it.",
"",
"To judge by the way she treats him now, if she were to assist in making",
"laws would she not be still more unjust than she now is, to her own sex,",
"and lenient to the other.",
"",
"If man go unpunished, of human law, for this sin, justice will find him",

"I went to the door. Callahan was coming up the walk between two",

"",
"\"Callahan, stop! haven't you promised to be a good woman when you are",

"",
"She looked at me, lowered her voice, but kept on with her talk. In a few",
"moments I spoke again,--",
"",
"\"Callahan, stop!\"",
"",
"She turned to me, and answered, but pleasantly,--",
"",
"\"Can't the Deputy take care of me?\"",
"",
"\"Certainly! but you ought to have respect enough to my feelings to talk",

"",
"\"I have cut my hands awfully;\" and she held out her arm towards me.",
"",
"\"Yes, you have. Shall I bind it up for you?\"",
"",
"I sent for bandages and water, and bound up her hands and arms. She",

"",
"\"Stop, Callahan! will you be gentle and patient while you are here with",
"me?\"",
"",
"\"Yes, for you I will. But look here! my arm pains me, and it's swelled",

"",
"\"I think you can see the Doctor if you wish. I think he had better see",
"it. I'll go ask the Deputy to send him in.\"",
"",
"\"Thank you; I wish you would. I'm afraid there's glass in it, and it",
"will be awful sore if it stays there.\"",
"",
"I whistled for the Deputy, told him what Callahan said, and he sent the",
"Doctor in.",
"",
"When she was first locked in he had told me not to open her cell unless",
"he were present. He was a new Deputy who had come into office that day,",
"and evidently felt the responsibility that was attached to his office,",

"",
"\"You will come round when it is time to give her food?\"",
"",
"\"Yes.\"",
"",
"I thought he was afraid of her violence; but I had no apprehension on",
"that score, so when the Doctor came, not thinking of the order, I opened",
"the cell as I had always done under the other Deputy. I had occasion to",
"think, afterwards, that he did not wish her to tell her own story,",
"unless it was in his presence; or intended to prevent her altogether.",
"",
"The front door of the kitchen stood open, and the Doctor came in that",
"way without seeing any of the officers.",

"",
"\"She got angry and struck her hand through the window.\"",

"\"I called to little red-headed Jones,--you know that little dumpy thing",
"that fetches the work for us,--I called to Jones to fetch me some work.",
"She was talking to that little fire-brand of a Harlan that takes care",
"of the engine in the work-room. Well, you see, she felt so nice to be",
"taken notice of by Harlan, that she wouldn't mind when I spoke. She",
"pretended not to hear. I called louder, 'Jones, fetch me some work,'",
"Jones was mad then, and said, 'I'll fetch it when I please.' Then I told",
"her to fetch me some work now, and do her talking afterwards: 'That's",
"what you're here for,' I said. Harlan was mad, and went straight out",
"into the men's shop and reported me. The Master and the Deputy came",
"right in, and made towards me. I was mad; for if anybody was reported it",
"ought to be Harlan and Jones, for it is against the rules for them to be",
"talking together; but 'twasn't against the rules for me to ask for work.",
"When I saw the Master and the Deputy coming straight to me, to lock me",
"up, I pulled up a chair to knock him down, I was so mad to think I was",
"going to be locked up for nothing, and Jones to be let go when she had",
"been breaking the rules. And Harlan to report me, when he helped her",
"break 'em. The little spit-fire!\"",
"",
"\"Why didn't you wait and see if you were going to be locked up, and tell",
"the Master how it was, before you took up a chair to strike him down?\" I",
"asked.",
"",
"\"She's green, Doctor! Tell him! he wouldn't let me tell him anything!",
"Many's the time I've been locked up and didn't know what 'twas for. Look",
"here, wouldn't it make you mad to be locked up when you wasn't to blame?",
"Look here, do you blame me for being mad?\"",
"",
"I could not say yes, and tell the truth. There is not a human heart but",
"what would resent such injustice. There are but few who would not resist",
"it if they could. I could not say no, because it might be construed into",
"encouraging insubordination. I did not feel it incumbent on me to think",
"the Master in the right because he was the Master, and she the convict.",
"I deliberately committed the vulgarity of listening to a convict's",
"story; but did not think it necessary to tell her my thoughts.",
"",
"\"Callahan, you mustn't ask me such questions. I am sorry for you, and",
"will make you as comfortable as I can.\"",
"",
"The doctor put some compresses on her arm, wet them with water, and",
"ordered her some to drink.",
"",
"\"Some water for Callahan to drink! Quick! The doctor has ordered it!\" I",
"echoed. I thought I heard an officer's step at the farther end of the",
"prison, and it was a legitimate supposition that if it were the new",
"Deputy, who was coming, she would get no such favor. Unless she got the",
"water and drank it before he came, she would not get it at all.",
"",
"It had been whispered to me that the Master had thrown Callahan on the",
"floor in his anger, when she caught up the chair, and put his foot on",
"her neck. I saw a mark of dirt on the lower part of her cheek and neck.",
"I looked closely at it. The skin was grazed as though a boot-heel had",
"been ground against it.",
"",
"\"Callahan, what is that dirt on your cheek and neck?\" I asked.",
"",
"She put up her hand and passed it across her face and neck at the place",
"where I saw the dirt. She knew exactly where to find the mark of which I",
"spoke. The boot had evidently been there.",
"",
"\"He did hurt me some,\" she said.",
"",
"\"Who?\" I asked.",

"\"On your cheek and neck?\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am.\"",
"",
"\"What for?\"",
"",
"\"To hold me down.\"",
"",
"\"Let me see.\"",
"",
"I examined the flesh; it was a little discolored as though it had been",
"bruised. It was evident that the tale that had been told me was true.",
"Was it necessary for that man--or the monster--in taking the chair away",
"from that woman, with two men to help him, to throw her upon the floor,",
"and place his foot on her neck?",
"",
"\"He was pretty well seas over. He's always savage when he is. I knew",
"he'd just had a horn when I saw him coming, and that's one thing made me",
"mad. Look here; folks are sent down here for getting drunk. Do you think",
"it'll ever cure 'em to put a drunkard over 'em?\"",
"",
"I did not make Callahan any reply; but I thought of the old proverb, \"It",
"takes a rogue to catch a rogue;\" but whether a rogue may be",
"advantageously set to cure one, is another question, and one upon which",
"a great deal of discussion might be spent, before popular judgment",
"would decide it in the affirmative.",

"Deputy made his appearance.",
"",

"Callahan's temper. They had got her pretty well under; but it was not",
"quite broken.",
"",
"Her constitution was in a fair way to be broken, her temper might share",

"How can one person teach another to control his temper when he is",
"ignorant of the way, and does not practice the government of his own?",
"",
"When I was left alone in the prison, I sat down before Callahan's cell",
"door. I thought over the object of punishment. Is it intended to deter",
"the vicious from continuing in crime? That is the apparent object. Then,",
"ought it not to be adapted to the crime, and administered by those who",
"are free from the same faults? Instead of that, it was left, in this",
"instance, an almost irresponsible power, in the hands of ignorance and",
"cruelty, and if report were not mistaken, of kindred sin.",
"",
"I thought, some mother's heart is aching for you, poor Callahan; such",

"less. Injustice and severity will never soften your heart, or enlighten",
"your understanding. God pity you, and interpose in your behalf!",
"",
"\"What are you thinking of?\" asked Callahan.",
"",
"\"How did you know that I was thinking?\"",
"",
"\"I looked through the key-hole, and saw you looking straight to the",
"floor, biting your nails.\"",
"",
"\"I was thinking of you, Callahan.\"",
"",
"\"You was thinking what a wicked wretch I am?\"",
"",
"\"I wish you might become better, and never come in this place again. It",
"is a great deal of suffering for so little comfort as you can take in",
"sin. Won't you try to do better, Callahan?\"",
"",
"\"I can't in here. They are just as bad as I am that put me in here, and",
"they'll never make me any better.\"",
"",
"There was the injustice for which she had suffered rankling in her",
"heart.",
"",
"\"It is more what we do ourselves than what others do to us which makes",
"us happy or unhappy.\"",
"",
"\"It's what they've done to me that makes me unhappy, and if ever I catch",
"them ---- outside, I'll pay 'em back,--I will, if I go to h--l for it!\"",
"",
"\"Callahan, Callahan, be patient and gentle! Don't think of any wicked",
"things to do outside, but think how to behave so that you can stay",
"there. Remember it was for your own deeds that you came in here. If you",
"hadn't been in here, they couldn't have put you in the black cell. Be",
"gentle and patient while you are here, now that it can't be helped, and",
"never come again.\"",
"",
"\"For you, I will; and I'll try not to go in the ways that bring me here.",
"But if I should meet them, I know I should forget it all. I should think",
"about it, and it would make me so mad. If I was out of the right way,",
"and got in here, the Master had no right to lock me up here for what I",
"did not do.\"",
"",
"I had no justification of that proceeding to offer, so I said nothing",
"more.",
"",
"\"Will you please give me a drink of water?\" asked Callahan in a moment.",
"",
"\"Callahan, you know that I cannot! Why do you hurt my feelings by asking",
"me?\"",
"",
"\"You have the keys,--you could give it to me, and the Deputy would never",
"know it. If you knew how dry I am you would.\"",
"",
"\"I cannot, Callahan. When I go out of here I can tell those who make the",
"rules, how hard it is to go so long without drinking, and how tiresome",
"it is to lie, and sit, and stand on the stones, and perhaps they will",
"change them; but I cannot disobey.\"",
"",
"\"O dear!\" she sighed, and began to sing. Every sound went through my",
"heart like the stab of a sharp knife. If that were my child! was the",
"agonizing thought. What keeps my children from such a fate? The loving",
"care of Him who holds the hearts of all in His hand. I could have gone",
"prostrate on the cold stones to thank Him that He had saved them from",
"such a fate, and me from such an agony of sorrow. How can I show my",
"gratitude? By trying to make less hard the hapless lot of the",
"unfortunates around me, and teaching them in the principles that lead to",
"better practices.",
"",
"My tears almost choked my utterance as I called to her, \"Callahan, stop",
"that singing unless you mean to break my heart!\"",
"",
"O'Brien had been standing on the steps that led to the kitchen, only a",
"few feet from me. She came along and sat down on a low stool at my feet.",
"",
"\"How different you are to what I thought you was when you came in here.",
"You stepped round so square and independent, I thought we had got a hard",
"mistress.\"",
"",
"\"Look here!\" said Callahan, \"it does me good to speak to you sometimes.",
"It is easier to be patient, and the time don't seem so long. Look here!",
"Do you love Hardhack?\"",
"",
"\"I know very little about her.\"",
"",
"\"I heard her in the kitchen scolding awhile ago, and you took it as cool",
"as could be. If I'd been you I'd put her out. She has no right to come",
"in your place and give orders. It sets me crazy to hear her.\"",
"",
"\"If I could not keep my own temper when I am annoyed, how could I teach",
"you to keep yours?\"",
"",
"\"That's it,\" said O'Brien. \"Hardhack gets mad in the shop, and scolds",
"us, and we scold back; and then we get punished. I wish there was",
"somebody to report her, too.\"",
"",
"\"Girls, did you ever hear of One who said, 'Love your enemies, bless",
"them that curse you'?\"",
"",
"\"Yes; but I never saw anybody do it,\" said O'Brien.",
"",
"\"Did you ever try to do it, Callahan?\"",
"",
"\"No! I always thought 'twas all moonshine. It'll do to preach about.\"",
"",
"\"It will do to practice, too. Suppose you try it towards Mrs. Hardhack,",
"and see how much happier you will feel.\"",
"",
"\"Ha! ha! ha!\" resounded through the prison in continuous echoes.",
"",
"\"It has done me good to laugh. I don't feel half so mad with her as I",
"did.\"",
"",
"\"O'Brien, I came very near sending you to the shop to-day, when you",
"scolded Allen so hard. Be careful or you will change your mistress",
"before you know it. You keep me in constant anxiety lest the Deputy, or",
"some of the other Matrons should come in and hear you. In that case it",
"would be beyond my power to help you.\"",
"",
"\"If you do send me to the shop you will have me home again in less than",
"twenty-four hours, one of your bread-and-water boarders.\"",
"",
"She understood how to meet that threat.",
"",
"\"I don't know but Hardhack will get me into solitary as it is. When she",
"came through the kitchen this noon, she saw me eating a piece of fish",
"with my bread,--we'd been stripping it off for the hash, and I took a",
"piece. She asked me who gave me liberty to eat fish. I told her, nobody.",
"She asked me how I dared to eat that fish without permission. I should",
"have made her a saucy answer only I knew it would make you feel bad, so",
"I didn't say anything.\"",
"",
"\"I am glad you had so much thought, and exercised so much self-control.\"",
"",
"\"I wasn't afraid of Hardhack.\"",
"",
"\"I am glad you had so much regard for me. It gives me a great deal of",
"pleasure to know of your good behavior. Don't you feel better, yourself,",
"for doing what is right?\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am; I do! and when you tell me I do right, it makes me feel",
"quite like a woman again; as though I was somebody.\"",
"",
"Self-respect goes a long way towards creating good behavior, and",
"commendation given, where it is deserved, produces that effect. I",
"watched for a chance to praise them when they did well, and bestowed the",
"approval wherever I could find the opportunity.",
"",
"There was no lack of discrimination on their part. They were aware when",
"they committed intentional wrong, and, as a rule, acknowledged it when",
"rebuked in a kind spirit. With the same understanding they appreciated",
"the praise when it was deserved. Gratitude was aroused when it was",
"given, and the satisfaction they enjoyed was an incentive to strive to",
"obtain more.",
"",
"I had constant proof that the exercise of kindness was far more",
"effectual in getting my work done than that of stern authority.",
"",
"That afternoon I had wished O'Brien to take more pains with her",
"scrubbing, and had said to her,--",
"",
"\"Your floor looks red and nice,\"--the kitchen floor was of brick,--\"but",
"do you notice that soiled strip in that corner, under the table? A dingy",
"border spoils all the effect of your labor.\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am. I saw it when I was scrubbing; but I was so tired, and my",

"fault finding either arouses anger from its injustice, or paralyzes all",
"effort to do well.",

"",
"It was a rule of the place to shift every labor, when it could be",
"effected, by the one to whom it belonged, upon some other person. That",
"is, in the female department. The example set by the Head Matron was",
"considered worthy of imitation, and copied with an accuracy deserved by",
"a better one.",
"",
"To impose upon an officer, ignorant of the ways of the place, was a",
"favorite entertainment of some of the others.",
"",
"They commenced to hand me along from one to another when I wished for",
"things to use, or for information, giving me a long chase to find it;",
"but a short time, only, was required to extinguish that entertainment. I",
"refused to take orders or information from any one but the Deputy.",
"",
"My inquiries of him, and statements of what I had been told, exposed",
"them. They got reproof instead of entertainment, which, of course,",
"created resentment that vented itself in a thousand of those little",
"annoying inventions in which unamiable women are so ingenious.",
"",
"The reprisals Mrs. Hardhack made did not always redound to my",
"inconvenience alone,--my women came in for a share in the retaliation. A",
"new Receiving Matron was told to take no trouble about the dresses of my",
"women in the kitchen,--it was no matter how they looked. The shorter she",
"kept them, the better the Master would like it. The less they had to",
"wear the more money would be saved to the institution. In consequence,",
"dresses sufficient to make them decent were withheld.",
"",
"I made a statement of some of these things to the Deputy. He said,--",
"",
"\"The Matrons have been in the habit of settling those small matters",
"among themselves.\"",
"",
"\"So we might if either of us had the authority to dictate. If Mrs.",
"Hardhack has the authority to control, and gives the order that my women",
"are to go dirty and ragged, as you see them, I appeal to you. Just look",
"at them as you see them now. Those dresses are all they have, and I can",
"get no better without an order from you.\"",
"",
"He looked at them. The angry color flashed into his face, and his teeth",
"were set together. In about two hours tidy dresses were sent in to my",
"women.",
"",
"I went on,--",
"",
"\"If she has no authority, but is meddling to make mischief, will you",
"please see that she does it no longer. I know it is not the Deputy's",
"business to be settling these little disagreements among the Matrons;",
"but I have no one else to go to. We have no one to regulate these",
"matters for us but you. You call them small matters; so they may be to",
"one who looks on; but our life, every day, is made up of them. And if",
"you take them home, and make them your own, you will not think them so",
"very small. Neither you nor I would consider it a small matter to go",
"dirty and ragged. Would you allow one of your male officers to keep the",
"men who are under another officer dirty and ragged, out of sheer malice,",
"or for any reason?\"",
"",
"\"They could not do it,--I should not allow it.\"",
"",
"\"And you are there to see it, and have the authority to prevent it. And",
"as you have undertaken to do the duty of the Head Officer on this side,",
"I see no other way but to appeal to you in these cases of ours. I have",
"no authority to prevent the mischievous interference of Mrs. Hardhack;",
"and to aggravate, in return, I cannot. She has the advantage of me in",
"the disposition and ability to do so. She has ample opportunity to",
"meddle with the affairs of the other Matrons, because they are sent to",
"her for instruction; and also to give her interpretation of the Rules.",
"Mrs. Hardhack is not so much to blame for what she does. She is only",
"following the bent of her own disposition, as the opportunity to do so",
"is given her. The Head Matron comes to me, and says,--'Control your own",
"place. Mrs. Hardhack has nothing to do with it. If she makes trouble",
"with another Matron, she shall surely be discharged. She has been",
"discharged three times, and begged herself back; but if we say to her,",
"go again, she will surely go.' Then she goes to Mrs. Hardhack, and",
"says,--'You go over to the wash-room and tell the Receiving Matron about",
"her place. You know all about the Rules and things better than I do. I",
"don't know what I should do without you.' That pleases Mrs. Hardhack,",
"and she meddles with everything, and makes trouble all around.\"",
"",
"\"I will do all I can to help you.\"",
"",
"\"I know; but I am tired. The care is altogether too much, and the",
"mismanagement of the place makes it intolerable. Explain to the",
"Receiving Matron, if you please, that she is under obligation to wash",
"and mend the clothes of my women the same that she does the others, and",
"give them out another dress when one fails.\"",
"",
"\"I will do that.\"",
"",
"That night I was speaking of the severe labor required of the officers",
"in the institution to Mrs. Hardhack. She turned to me, and said",
"roughly,--",

"\"I find it easy enough.\"",
"",
"It was just the right moment for me to tell her why she found it so much",
"easier than the rest of us.",
"",
"\"You may well find it so, in comparison with the rest of us. You have an",
"hour more of rest in the morning than I, and an hour more at night,",
"making nine hours of rest from labor in the twenty-four, instead of the",
"seven that I have. During those nine hours you are entirely free from",
"care, and sleep in a quiet room in the house. During the fifteen that",
"you are on duty you have the entire help of the only Relief Matron in",
"the institution, which ought to be divided among us all, so that you can",
"go out when you please.\"",
"",
"\"Perhaps, when you have been in the institution as long as I, you will",
"get as many favors.\"",

"\"I could not take them, if I got them by robbery. I could not enjoy my",
"liberty if the work which belonged to me were imposed upon another,",
"making her burden double, for me to have it.\"",
"",
"A smart rap was all the woman could feel. I really grew in her esteem by",
"cutting her up with my sharpness, and she attempted to ingratiate",
"herself into my favor. I will relate how, and how I discovered it.",
"",
"The next night I was called to lock a woman in solitary. She walked into",
"her cell in silence, and I as silently turned the key upon her. I did",
"not ask the Deputy why she was put there. She was brought up from the",
"shop, and I supposed some miserable tale was appended to her",
"incarceration which I did not care to know.",

"\"Do you know what I am in here for?\"",

"\"It was for mocking you. I know it was wrong; but the others did it, and",
"I did it too, and I got caught.\"",
"",
"\"Who caught you?\"",
"",
"\"Mrs. Hardhack. I know it was wrong, I was foolish, but I'll never do it",
"again. The others did it, and so I did it, too.\"",
"",
"\"And you hadn't courage to do right when others were doing wrong. You",
"are a brave girl! Do you know that there must be order kept in this",
"place, and that there must be rules in order to keep order, and that you",
"must treat those who have the rules in charge with respect?\"",
"",
"\"Yes, ma'am; and I never will do it again. Will you get me out?\"",
"",
"\"I'll try; but you must always treat me with respect, and all of the",
"other officers in the same way. I shall never intercede for you again.\"",
"",
"\"I will never give you any reason to.\"",
"",
"When the Deputy came round I asked,--",
"",
"\"Is Mary Muran in solitary for mimicking me?\"",
"",
"He said, \"Yes.\"",
"",
"\"Was it for the second offense? Had she been admonished once?\"",
"",
"\"She knew better.\"",
"",
"\"Your Rules and Regulations make no conditions that they know better.",
"They shall be admonished once, and, for the second offense punished.\"",
"",
"\"They wouldn't do exactly the same thing twice, perhaps; but they would",
"do something as near like it as they could.\"",
"",
"\"We have no help for that, if we obey the Rules.\"",
"",
"\"We should be constantly admonishing.\"",
"",
"\"Wouldn't that be better than constantly punishing? Isn't it better to",
"err on the side of mercy than on that of severity? It seems to me a very",
"severe punishment to put upon a girl for so slight an offense. I think I",
"could have administered a rebuke that would have prevented her repeating",
"it towards me. It really makes me very unhappy to think she is locked up",
"there for a disrespect shown me.\"",
"",
"\"If you are satisfied with the punishment she has had, you can let her",
"out.\"",
"",
"\"Indeed I am!\"",
"",
"If she had been one of my women perhaps I should not have reminded the",
"Deputy that he had transcended his orders. Mary Muran was a shop woman.",
"When she was released from her solitary confinement she would return to",
"the shop. Mrs. Hardhack would call him to account for letting her off",
"with so slight a punishment. I gave him an answer for her.",
"",
"I went directly to the girl's cell.",
"",
"\"You can go, Mary, and I hope you will never do so mean and foolish a",
"thing as to mimic a Matron again.\"",
"",
"\"I never will, and I shall always remember this kindness in you.\"",
"",
"I never knew her to require reproof again, while I was in the",
"institution. It was like the experience I had with every other prisoner.",
"There are, undoubtedly, those who return kindness with ingratitude, but",
"I never saw the kindness fail to produce good behavior while there.",
"",
"The long day's work, the night vigils, and the damp, noisome air of the",
"prison, were telling upon my health. I was getting an intermittent",
"pulse; chills and fainting every other morning.",
"",
"I asked the Housekeeper to let me have a cup of tea at half past six.",
"Unless I took it then, I was obliged to wait another hour, because I",
"must attend to giving out the breakfast of the prisoners. In doing that",
"duty I was made a three hours and a half watch before I had anything to",
"eat in the morning. She had given her permission for me to have it; and",
"I had availed myself of the privilege.",
"",
"One morning after setting my women about the work I wished to have done,",
"while I was gone, I went in to breakfast.",
"",
"Supervisor arose about that time, and made the important discovery, to",
"her, that the fire had gone out in her furnace, and her parlor was cold.",
"This was in May, consequently the weather was not very inclement.",
"",
"Her parlor was directly over the prisoners' kitchen; her front door over",
"the kitchen door. The steps that led up to her apartments went past our",
"windows. She often ran down these steps, and looked in the window to",
"give an order about the furnace. This morning she did so, and, not",
"seeing me, inquired where I was.",
"",
"\"Gone in to breakfast,\" was the reply.",
"",
"Annie O'Brien, who had charge of the furnace, brought me the order as",
"soon as I went in.",
"",
"\"Shall I have time to do it?\" she asked.",
"",
"\"No; it wants but eight minutes of breakfast time. It will take all of",
"that time to \"dish up\" your mush, and get your coffee ready. It will",
"take half an hour to clear the furnace and light the fire. I am sorry;",
"but you will be obliged to wait till after breakfast.\"",
"",
"Supervisor grew impatient, and the more impatient she was the colder she",
"grew. Her comfort was the first thing to be attended to in that",
"institution. The prisoners might go without their breakfast,--the",
"Matrons might faint away for want of food,--it was only paying her",
"proper respect to light her fire, as soon as the order was given.",
"",
"I was in her power, she could retaliate upon me.",
"",
"That evening I met her in the officers' dining-room, and asked her if",
"she wished me to keep a three hours and a half watch before breakfast.",
"She replied,--",
"",
"\"It has been done thirty-three years.\"",
"",
"\"Great changes have taken place in the world during the last",
"thirty-three years, and many more might be effected with advantage,\" I",
"remarked.",
"",
"\"I don't see how you can find time to go to breakfast at that hour.\"",
"",
"\"I should not find time at any hour unless I took it.\"",
"",
"\"That is so; but they were dishing out when I went down. You ought to be",
"there when they are dishing out.\"",
"",
"\"I suppose so; but I have an order to be in the prison a large part of",
"the time, at all three of the meals, when they are dishing out, and they",
"are obliged to do it without my oversight.\" Doing your duty, I would",
"have liked to have added.",
"",
"\"Most of the officers like to go to table with the others for company.\"",
"",
"\"I did not come here for society. In wishing to breakfast earlier, I was",
"not consulting my taste, but trying to take care of my health. Unless I",
"am made somewhat comfortable, I shall break down, and be obliged to",
"leave.\"",
"",
"\"Comfortable!\" she echoed. I was not surprised that the word sounded so",
"strangely to her, connected with any other person than herself.",
"",
"Discipline had become a mania, and it was applied as severely to the",
"officers as the prisoners, so far as it was in her power to effect it.",
"",
"The whole study, it appeared to me, was to keep them on duty all day,",
"without relaxation; and they were cut off from every means of enjoyment",
"which was not connected with their care.",
"",
"There was a common sitting-room where the male officers and Matrons sat",
"and talked together, when they were not on duty, when I went there; but",
"that was taken away, and made into a bed-room, so that there was no",
"place for them to meet except in their own bed-rooms, the halls, or on",
"the grounds.",
"",
"If human ingenuity were to set itself to work to invent a position of",
"unmitigated discomfort, that prison life would give some excellent",
"hints. The heads of the establishment were certainly very keen in",
"discovering ways to circumscribe the comforts of its inmates.",
"",
"I made a statement of my circumstances to Supervisor; not with any",
"expectation of obtaining any consideration, but merely to place my view",
"of things before her.",
"",
"\"You cannot wonder that I do not consider that I am made comfortable",
"when you think of my seventeen hours of labor in the day, to which is",
"added the care of the prison, nights.\"",
"",
"\"The care of the prison, nights!\" she echoed, and turned up her nose in",
"disdain.",
"",
"I did not explain; but reminded her that the Housekeeper had two hours",
"and a half more rest in the morning than I.",
"",
"\"I am glad she can have it; and it would be only kind to give me my tea",
"a little earlier, as I cannot have it.\"",
"",
"\"She has to be up nights frequently.\"",
"",
"\"No oftener than I, and not so late. I lock her women up after she",
"dismisses them from her kitchen.\"",
"",
"\"I shall lose a good Housekeeper if you have your breakfast before the",
"rest. She won't stay if she is obliged to get it.\"",
"",
"\"She told me she was willing I should have it.\"",
"",
"\"She is unwilling now.\"",
"",
"I readily saw why she had become unwilling. She herself had made up her",
"mind that it was not to be given me, because I delayed the kindling of",
"her fire, and she had made the Housekeeper unwilling.",
"",
"\"You had better keep her. It is doubtful if I could remain with that",
"favor. It is with great difficulty that I get through the day now, with",
"the help of a tonic that the Doctor has given me.\"",
"",
"I sent in my resignation the next morning. I told the Master that I",
"would stay till he could find some one to take my place.",
"",
"As I was no longer an officer on duty, merely a temporary supply of",
"help, I took the liberty to go back to bed, after I had called the women",
"out, to get an additional hour or two of sleep. I found that it helped",
"me wonderfully in getting through the day.",
"",
"When the Deputy came round, I reported myself.",
"",
"\"You did not do your duty!\" was his curt reply.",
"",
"\"I am not on duty and I shall do it every morning that I stay here to",
"oblige you. If I were the only one in the institution who does not do",
"her duty, it would be well to single me out for reproof. Indeed I am not",
"sure that I am not doing my duty--to myself. If the women in the",
"officers' kitchen can work two hours and a half in the morning without a",
"mistress, so that the Housekeeper can get her rest, why may not the",
"women in the prisoners' kitchen do the same thing, so that their Matron",
"may get rest?\"",
"",
"The Deputy smiled at my reasoning. \"I cannot discipline you; you are not",
"one of the officers of the institution now. I get up nearly as early as",
"you do.\"",
"",
"\"I hope you enjoy it.\"",
"",
"\"I cannot say that I exactly enjoy it; but my duty calls me, and I do",
"it.\"",
"",
"\"You are a strong, healthy man, and can bear a great deal of care. But",
"you do not have as much as I. You have your rest through the night",
"without it. You have your watchman in prison, and go to your bed in the",
"house. That prison is no place for a woman to sleep in, and the care of",
"it is no work for a woman, who works all day,--and for no one else who",
"is obliged to be on duty through the day.\"",
"",
"\"It is hardly fit work for a woman to sleep in a prison, and take care",
"of it nights.\"",
"",
"\"Aside from its fitness I cannot do it for want of strength. I hope you",
"will find some one to take my place very soon. I saw two or three",
"advertisements in last night's paper for such a place.\"",
"",
"The next morning, I fainted in attempting to rise, and was obliged to go",
"down in my night-dress and shawls to call the women out.",
"",
"I should have told the Master that day that I could rise no longer to",
"call the women out, only that I heard that Mrs. Hardhack wished to go",
"out that night, to return at seven the next morning. If I refused to get",
"up, she would be obliged to stay at home to do that duty.",
"",
"I thought I would heap one coal of kindness on her head, so I told her I",
"would try to get through with it one more morning. She accepted the",
"favor; but it was like casting pearls before swine--she did not thank",
"me.",
"",
"As soon as she returned the next morning, I wrote the Master a note,",
"saying I could rise no longer to call the women out, and I hoped he",
"would find some one to relieve me of all duty as soon as possible.",
"",
"He took no notice of my note till afternoon; then I heard him, in his",
"measured tread, stalking along the prison floor. The dinner was out of",
"the way; nearly all of the work attended to for the day. The time I had",
"spent from morning till afternoon was so much gained for which he did",
"not pay.",
"",
"\"You are not willing to get up and unlock any longer in the morning, you",
"say?\"",
"",
"\"I cannot, sir; I am too ill.\"",
"",
"\"Then we don't want you here any longer,\" was the gentlemanly response.",
"",
"\"I am happy to be relieved of my duties here.\"",
"",
"\"You may go now, the sooner the better,\" was his gentle reply.",
"",
"\"Yes, sir; I will leave directly.\"",
"",
"I called my maid, packed my trunk, and made all haste to depart. I made",
"my adieus as brief as possible. My women, with one exception, were",
"crying and lamenting my departure, and I truly regretted to leave the",
"poor wretches in such merciless care.",
"",
"\"I shall spend the rest of my time in solitary,\" said O'Brien.",
"",
"\"I shall get locked up the first thing,\" said Lissett.",
"",
"\"I shall try to get into the shop,\" said Allen. \"I never can stand it",
"here after ye.\"",
"",
"\"My heart is as black after ye as that stove,\" sobbed McMullins.",
"",
"It was many a day and night, after I went out from that prison, before",
"the sights and sounds that I saw and heard there left my mental sight",
"and hearing.",
"",
"I thought as I went away, I will go from door to door through this broad",
"Commonwealth, state what I have learned of woman's condition in prison,",
"and beseech every other woman to help open the doors of her ignorance,",
"and degradation, to the light of the knowledge which will lead to",
"reformation.",
"",
"Every one who has the cause of humanity at heart will echo the",
"cry,--open the doors of our prisons, as the doors of other public",
"institutions are thrown open, so that those who support may have an",
"opportunity to inspect them.",
"",
"It is the right of every tax-payer to know what is done within our",
"prison walls at all times. It is the duty of every Christian man to make",
"himself acquainted with the moral bearing of the discipline which",
"obtains within them.",
"",
"It is the duty of every religious woman to see that her fellow woman is",
"not trampled down in degradation and vice, lower than her own sins would",
"carry her, by the heel of her master in discipline.",
"",
"Let the prison doors be opened, and the inside of them exposed to the",
"view of all. Knowledge awakens interest, and interest leads to action.",
"",
"If the people of this land could be roused to examine the subject, our",
"prisons would soon be managed upon principles which would tend to the",
"elevation of the wretched beings who now come out of them more degraded",
"and hardened in the commission of crime than they go in.",

"God grant that the day filled with such blessing for the poor convict ",
