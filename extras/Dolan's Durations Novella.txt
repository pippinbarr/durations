OKAY, SO WE'VE GOT ONE HOUR TO WRITE THIS NOVELLA. HERE WE GO! THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD. I'M EXCITED TO GET STARTED. I THINK THE FIRST THING WE'LL NEED TO DO IS TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF SETTING. I'M IMAGINING A ROOM, MAYBE SORT OF PINKISH IN COLOR. THERE'S A DESK THERE, WHICH IS YELLOW, AND A CHAIR, WHICH IS RED. A MAN SITS AT THE CHAIR FACING A TYPEWRITER AND BLANK PIECE OF PAPER. SO, I THINK NOW IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY A SETTING, BUT EVEN A PROTAGONIST - PERHAPS EVEN A CONFLICT AS WELL. LET ME EXPLAIN MYSELF. THE SETTING, OBVIOUSLY, IS THE PINK ROOM WITH YELLOW DESK AND RED CHAIR. THE PROTAGONIST, OF COURSE, WOULD BE NONE OTHER THAN THE MAN SITTING IN THE CHAIR, AND IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME FOR A MOMENT, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE PROTAGONIST DOES INDEED HAVE A CONFLICT: THAT OF WHAT AND HOW TO FILL THE BLANK PAGE THAT SITS BEFORE HIM. YES, THIS IS THE CLASSIC SETUP OF LITERATURE. A PERSON, A PLACE, A GOAL, AND A SERIES OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. FANTASTIC. NOW, FOR SIMPLICITY'S SAKE, LET'S IMAGINE THAT THE MAN HAS DECIDED TO WRITE A NOVELLA ABOUT A VIDEO GAME. THE PROTAGONIST IS A CLEVER PERSON, PERHAPS TOO CLEVER, AND WANTS TO IMAGINE A PECULIAR GAME THAT REPRESENTS NOT ONLY A FUNNY DIVERSION, BUT ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS EXEMPLARY OF THE LIFE HE LEADS. SO MANY GAMES THESE DAYS ARE ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE OR KILLING PEOPLE OR SNEAKING AROUND. AND WHEN YOU'RE NOT KILLING SOMEONE, YOU'RE AN INANE CARTOONISH FIGURE EMBROILED IN MUNDANE AND ABSURD TASKS LIKE SLASHING FRUITS OR CRUSHING CANDY GEMS. NEITHER OF THESE PURSUITS ARE VERY REFLECTIVE OF THE PROTAGONIST'S LIFE AT ALL, A LIFE FILLED WITH LITERATURE AND HUMOR AND SORROW AND LITTLE THINGS LIKE TRIPS TO THE GROCERY AND STROLLS THROUGH THE CITY. NEVER HAS HE KILLED A MAN, OR EVEN AN ANIMAL, NOR HAS HE HAD THE TIME TO IDLY SWAT AT FRUITS OR CRUSH CANDY GEMS. TRULY, THE MAN HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM. WHAT KIND OF GAME COULD REPRESENT HIS QUITE LIFE SPENT DEDICATED TO THE CRAFT OF WRITING? AND OF COURSE, THERE IT IS. HE IMAGINES A GAME WHEREIN THE PLAYER LITERALLY DOES THAT - WRITES! YES, THE PREMISE OF THE GAME MIGHT MIMIC HIS OWN PURSUITS FOR ONCE. THANK GOD. HE IMAGINES THE SCENE. A MAN SITTING DOWN WITH PEN AND PAPER?  A QUILL AND INK AT A WRITING DESK? NO, TOO  MUCH PRETENSE. STOP PUTTING ON AIRS. THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF YOU WERE TRYING TO CREATE A GAME ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK PEOPLE THINK YOU THINK THEY THINK ABOUT WRITING AND WHAT IT MEANS, WHICH IS ALL WELL AND GOOD, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PROTAGONIST HAS SET OUT TO DO HERE. NO! HE WANTS A GAME THAT AVOIDS THE PITFALLS OF DETACHED VIOENCE AND INANE REPETITION WHILE UPHOLDING THE BASIC TENETS OF WHAT PILLARS SUPPORT HIS MEAGER LIFE. SO, HE THINK, LET'S MAKE IT MORE HONEST. WHAT ON EARTH DO I DO WITH MY TIME? I SIT IN MY ROOM AND WRITE. MY ROOM IS PAINTED AND HAS A DESK, ALONG WITH A BED AND A DRESSER AND A COMPUTER. I THINK WE CAN SAFELY EXPECT TO PUT ALL OF THAT IN THERE, INTO THE GAME THAT IS. YES. BUT WE'VE ALSO GOT ALL OF THIS LAUNDRY, THE PROTAGONIST WRITES INTO THE STORY THAT HE'S WRITING TO DESCRIBE A VIDEOGAME WORLD. AND THERE ROOM IS FILLED WITH AIR. HOW WILL WE MODEL THAT IN A GAME? AND THERE'S OF COURSE THE RUMBLE OF INDUSTRY THAT ROLLS THROUGH THE WINDOW WITH REGULARITY. AND OF COURSE, THE ROOM IS SUPPORTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF THE SURROUNDING BUILDING, AND ONE MUST INCLUDE THE CONTEXT OF HOW THIS ALL CAME TOGE - WAIT, WAIT. NO, NONE OF THIS WILL DO. WE NEED TO STRIP THINGS DOWN TO THEIR ELEMENTS. THE CORE PARTS. NONE OF THIS EXTRA STUFF. WHAT GAME HAS EVER INCLUDED EVERYTHING? MAYBE SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE, BUT LORD WE SHOULDN'T PRESUME TO BE THE INNOVATORS OF A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF TECHNOLOGY, ON TOP OF THE ALREADY ARDUOUS TASK OF ESTABLISHING THE PREMISE OF A GAME THAT ACCURATELY REPRESENTS MY OWN DAILY STRUGGLES (THINKS THE PROTAGONIST IN THE PINK ROOM AS HE ENGENDERS TO FILL THE PAGE THAT SITS BEFORE HIM BY DESCRIBING A VIDEOGAME). SO, LET'S JUST KEEP IT TO THE BARE BONES. THERE HAS TO BE ME, OR SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS ME, AND LET'S KEEP IT SIMPLE: A LITTLE SPRITE, WHICH WILL REPRESENT THE GAMES PROTAGONIST. NOT TO MENTION ME! OR ANYONE LIKEMINDED PERSON WHO EMPATHISIZES WITH THE PLIGHT OF THE CHARACTER (AND BY EXTENTIONS MYSELF, AND NO DOUBT THEMSELVES). GREAT, NOT OF COURSE THAT PERSON WILL HAVE TO BE SOMEWHERE, AND THOUGH WE COULD OF COURSE JUST PUT THEM IN A FORMLESS VOID (A ROOM IS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR WRITING), I THINK THIS DEDICATION TO SIMPLICITY MIGHT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. RATHER, LET'S GO AHEAD AND PUT THE WRITER SPRITE IN THAT MOST COMMON OF PLACES FOR WRITERS, AND PEOPLE IN GENERAL, TO BE: A ROOM. THERE, THE GAME CAN UNFOLD. OF COURSE, I THINK IT IMPORTANT THAT IN THE ROOM WE HAVE A PLACE WHERE THE SPRITE CAN ENDEAVOR TO WRITE. AGAIN, WE MIGHT JUST HAVE SOME KIND OF FLOATING KIOSK WHERE LITERATURE CAN BE INPUTTED, BUT THIS SEEMS NEEDLESSLY ABSTRACT. RATHER, LET'S USE A DESK. I FEAR FOR A MOMENT THAT WE ARE GETTING BOGGED DOWN IN THE DETAILS HERE, BUT I'M GOING TO FORGE AHEAD UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE HAVEN'T CROSSED TOO FAR INTO THE REALM OF OVER SATURATION. SO, ON THE DESK IS A SIMPLE WRITING INSTRUMENT, EITHER A COMPUTER OR A TYPEWRITER (MMMM, TYPEWRITER), AND OUR PROTAGONIST MUST ENDEAVOR TO WRITE UPON IT. PERFECT. NOW, WE ARE FACED WITH, FROM A DESIGN PERSPECTIVE, A CONUNDRUM. NORMALLY WHEN A PERSON WRITES, THEY SIMPLY LOOK WITH THEIR EYES JUST TO THE AREA BEYOND THEIR HEAD, SUCH THAT THEY OBSERVE A PIECE OF PAPER AND CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE TYPING. AS WE HAVE SET UP THE GAME TO CONTAIN A MAN, A DESK, AND A DEVICE, OUR EYES WILL BE OBSERVING THE PROCESS FROM SOME OTHER VANTAGE POINT THAN THE USUAL. I THINK THAT'S FINE, SO LONG AS WE UNDERSTAND WE ARE PART OF A LONG TRADITION OF VIDEO GAMES, WHEREIN WE CONTROL THE BODY OF A PERSON THAT WE OBSERVE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS, BUT SO MANY OF THOSE REPRESENT THAT EXACT TYPE OF GAME WE ARE TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM WITH THE ONE WE ARE IMAGINING HERE, AND WE THINK IT BEST TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM THAT TYPE OF SETUP. SO, IT IS CERTAINLY FINE TO HAVE THINGS ARRANGED THE WAY WE'VE DESCRIBED THUS FAR, FROM A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL AND THEMATIC LEVEL, BUT THE PRACTICAL ELEMENT OF ACTUALLY ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO TYPE AND ENJOY THE PROCESS HAS YET TO BE SOLVED. THAT IS, A KEY ELEMENT OF WRITING IS THE MENTAL INTERACTION WITH THAT WHICH YOU HAVE TYPED OR WRITTEN DOWN, AND IF THE PAPER  OR COMPUTER ON WHICH OUR SPRITE WRITES REMAINS  AT A SIZE THAT IS MATCHES THE SCALE OF THEIR OWN SIZE, THEN IT MIGHT PROVE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR ANY PLAYER TO SEE WHAT THEY'VE BEEN TYPING. WE MIGHT SAY TO OURSELVES THAT IF WE FOLLOW THE PREMISE OF A GAME, THEN THE PLAYER ISN'T TYPING, BUT RATHER THE SPRITE IN THE GAME IS TYPING, AT THE BEHEST OF THE PLAYER, AND THOUGH THIS MAY BE TRUE, IT IS SORT OF A MATTER OF SEMENTICS, AND ALSO SKIRTS THE ISSUE AROUND WHICH SO MANY GAMES ARE CENTERED: THAT IS, THE SORT OF MERGER BETWEEN THE PROJECTED SPRITE AND ACTING SELF. LET'S NOT GET INTO IT TOO MUCH, BUT LEAVE IT AT THE FACT THAT WE MIGHT AS WELL EQUATE, FOR A MOMENT, AT LEAST, THE ACTIONS OF THE SPRITE AND THE ACTIONS OF THE PLAYER. THERE'S A LAYER OF REMOVAL THAT WE CAN ALL ADMIT IS THERE, BUT IT HAS NO MEANING TOWARD WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. SO, WE NEED A WAY FOR THE PLAYER TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE TYPING, SO THAT THEY CAN GET INTO THE "ZONE" AND EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE SPRITE SO THAT THE SPRITE CAN WRITE AS DEEPLY AS IF THEY WERE A PERSON. I THHINK A FAIR WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO HAVE, ABOVE THE SPRITES HEAD, AN IMAGE OF A PIECE OF PAPER, REPRESENTING THE SPRITE'S VISION, SO THAT WE TOO , AS THE PLAYER, CAN SEE IT, SUCH THAT AS WE TYPE, WE KNOW WHAT WE'VE TYPED AND CAN COMMUNE WITH THE IDEAS USHERING FROM OUR OWN MIND INTO THE MIND OF OUR DIGITAL PROXY. PERFECT. SO, WE HAVE THEN A ROOM WITH A DESK AND COMPUTER, WHERE WE FIND THE GAME'S PROTAGONIST HELL BENT ON WRITING SOMETHING, THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PLAYER, AND WHOSE WORKS WILL BE DISPLAYED ON SCREEN AS A SORT OF PAPER/THOUGHT BUBBLE COMBO. GREAT. NOW, WHAT MIGHT REPRESENT THE SCENARIO THAT COMPLICATES THE SITUATION. ANY GAME WORTH ITS SALT HAS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SORT OF TURN THE SCREW SO TO SPEAK. SO, HOW CAN IT PLAY OUT. THE SPRITE IS TRYING TO WRITE, AND THEN, BOOM, IS ATTACKED BY AN ORC OR DEMON OR SOME SUCH. THEY DUEL FOR A MOMENT, AND IF THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE SPRITE WELL ENOUGH, AND BEATS THE INVADER, THEN THE PRIZE IS TO RETURN TO THE DESK AND CONTINUE WRITING. WE CAN IMAGINE THAT IF THE PLAYER FAILS TO WARD OFF THE INVADER, THE MONSTER WILL SNATCH AWAY SOME OF THE WRITING, SETTING THE SPRITE AND THE PLAYER BACK A BIT. YET, THIS MAKES US NOT FEEL RIGHT. WHEN WE WRITE, GOBLINS DO NOT BARGE INTO THE BEDROOM AND ASSAIL US OR STEAL OUR WORK. GOOD LORD, IF WE AREN'T EVEN GOING TO INCLUDE THE EXTRA DETAILS LIKE THE DRESSER NEXT TO THE DESK, WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE ADD ELEMENTS THAT DON'T EVEN EXIST, LIKE GOBLINS? SEEMS INCONSISTENT. OKAY, SO SCRATCH THAT THEN. INSTEAD, WE'LL NEED SOME KIND OF VILLAIN THAT ACTUALLY PRESENTS ITSELF TO WRITERS, ESPECIALLY MYSELF. WHAT CAN STOP SOMEONE FROM WRITING? IT'S A PRETTY EASY THING TO DO, AT LEAST PHYSICALLY. OF COURSE, THERE ARE A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS IN LIFE, LIKE WORK AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS, ETC, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM WORTH IT TO PUT ALL OF THAT IN HERE, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT CHANGING THE WHOLE TENOR OF THE GAME. AND OF COURSE WE COULD ARGUE THAT NOT INCLUDING ALL OF THAT DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT THE ACTUAL LIFE OF A WRITER, SOMEONE WHO BY NATURE IS HUMAN AND LIVES IN THIS WORLD, BUT WE MUST ANSWER THAT WE AREN'T TRYING TO ACCURATELY REPRESENT A WRITER'S LIFE, BUT INSTEAD TO ACCURATELY MIMIC A WRITER'S STRUGGLE RIGHT AT THE MOMENT OF DELIBERATE PURSUIT. HERE'S A SORT OF CONCESSION WE CAN MAKE THOUGH THAT MIGHT INCLUDE, AT LEAST TANGENTIALLY, THESE VERY THINGS, WITHOUT OVERCOMPLICATING THE GAME OR ITS PARTS. WHAT DOES A JOB TAKE FROM A WRITER? WHAT DOES A FAMILY TAKE? WHAT DOES EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD TAKE? 

TIME. 

SO, WE CAN ADD AN ELEMENT OF TIME TO THIS GAME WHICH WILL STAND IN FOR ALL OF THE OTHER DISTRACTIONS, THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE WHISKED AWAY OUR SPRITE WHEN THE GAME WAS OFF, AND WHICH HAVE DEMANDED CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE, SUCH THAT THE SPRITE IS LEFT WITH ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO WRITE HIS GREAT WORK. OF COURSE, THIS FUNCTION AS WELL ON A MACRO LEVEL, WHEREIN THE WRITER IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH A LARGER BODY OF WORK AND HAS HIS OWN LIFETIME TO CONTEND WITH. THAT SAID, WE SHOULDN'T ENDEAVOR TO MAKE THIS GAME LAST A WHOLE LIFETIME, BUT PERHAPS SOMETHING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF AN ACTUAL TIME ONE MIGHT SET ASIDE TO WRITE. HOW ABOUT AN HOUR? YES, AN HOUR SOUNDS GOOD. THAT'S ENOUGH TIME TO PUT DOWN ON PAPER QUITE A FEW WORDS, ESPECIALLY IN A RUSH. AND SINCE WE'RE LOOKING AT A VIDEO GAME HERE, THE QUALITY OF THOSE WORDS WILL NOT BE OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE. THIS IS BUT A SIMULATION THAT WE IMAGINE HERE.  THAT FREES US UP TO ADD A LITTLE LEVITY TO THIS SCENARIO, AND A LITTLE LEVITY THAT MIGHT EVEN NICELY REPRESENT THE WRITER'S STRUGGLE. LET'S ASK FOR THE PLAYER TO CONTROL THE SPRITE SO THAT THE SPRITE HAS TO WRITE, IN THE GIVEN TIME, WHICH IS A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO PLAY A GAME AND A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO SPEND WRITING, AN UNREASONABLE AMOUNT OF WRITING. THAT IS, IN THE HOUR, THE PLAYER MUST MAKE THE SPRITE WRITE A WHOLE BOOK. LET'S SAY A NOVELLA. THAT SHOULD PROVE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE AND GENERALLY CONVEY THE EMOTION OF WHAT A WRITER FEELS WHEN FACING THE PAGE IN A STATE OF URGENCY. WONDERFUL. SO, WE'VE GOT A SPRITE IN A ROOM WITH A DESK AND THING TO WRITE ON, AND WE'VE GOT THAT WRITING VISUALIZED ABOVE THE SPRITE'S HEAD FOR EASE OF VIEWING BY THE PLAYER, AND WE HAVE THE CONSTRAINT THAT ALL OF THE WRITING MUST BE PRODUCED IN AN HOUR, AND THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THAT WRITING IS A NOVELLA, A NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE END THAT IN ITS FRUSTRATION WILL NICELY REPRESENT THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING A WRITER ALL IN THE SPACE OF JUST ONE SIMPLE GAME. 

OKAY, OKAY, READER. TIME OUT. LET'S STEP BACK A SECOND TO REMEMBER WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. REMEMBER THAT THIS STORY IS NOT ABOUT A VIDEO GAME. REMEMBER THAT THIS STORY IS ABOUT A MAN IN A PINK ROOM ON A RED CHAIR AT A YELLOW DESK, AND REMEMBER THAT THIS MAN IS ENDEAVORING TO WRITE SOMETHING, AND REMEMBER THAT WE'VE IMAGINED THAT THE WRITER HAS DECIDED TO CREATE A VIDEO GAME, AND REMEMBER THAT THIS VIDEO GAME WHICH THE WRITER IS DESCRIBING IS ABOUT A SPRITE IN A SMALL ROOM CONTROLLED BY A PLAYER, A SPRITE THAT IS FACED WITH THE CONFLICT OF ATTEMPTING TO WRITE A NOVELLA. YES, SO FAR, THE PROTAGONIST OF OUR NOVEL HAS ESTABLISHED THE PREMISE OF A VIDEO GAME THAT HE IS IMAGINING. I THINK IT HIGH TIME THAT THE PROTAGONIST OF OUR OWN NOVEL GIVE THIS THING THAT HE HAS IMAGINED A TRY. CAN HE REALLY GO ON IMAGINING A GAME THAT HE THINKS IS SO REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS OWN DAILY STRUGGLES WITHOUT ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO SEE IF HIS IDEAS ARE ACCURATE? THAT WOULD BE A FOOLISH PLAN. SO, OUR PROTAGONIST, AFTER COMMISSIONING THE GAME TO BE MADE BY THE WONDERFUL PIPPIN BARR, A GAME DESIGNER, OUR PROTAGONIST TAKES A SEAT AT HIS COMPUTER AND BEGINS PLAYING. THE FIRST THING HE DOES IS TAKE IN THE SCENERY. DOES IT LOOK THE WAY HE'D HOPED? THEY WAY HE'D ASKED PIPPIN TO DESIGN IT? YES, YES IT DOES. THERE IS THE PINK ROOM. THERE IS THE CHAIR, THE SPRITE, THE PLACE TO WRITE. AND, JUST AS HE'D HOPED, THERE IS THE ABSTRACT SPACE ABOVE THE SPRITE WRHERE WRITING WILL BE SEEN BY THE PLAYER, WHICH, FOR THE TIME BEING, IS HIMSELF. HE THEN TESTS OUT THE CONTROLS. YEP, WHEN HE HITS AREAS OF HIS KEYBOARD, CORRESPONDING LETTERS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. GREAT. AND, YES, IT IS CLEAR TOO THAT HE HAS ONLY AN HOUR TO WORK. AND THE GOAL IS CLEARLY DISPLAYED: WRITE A NOVELLA. EVERYTHING HE ASKED FOR, ALL IN ONE SIMPLE PACKAGE. HE HOPES AGAINST HOPE THAT NO GOBLINS WILL SHOW UP TO INTERRUPT (HOW COULD PIPPIN HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THAT PASSING THOUGH, OF COURSE THE GOBLINS WON'T SHOW UP) AND THNE HE BEGINS TO TYPE. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE TO TRY THE GAME BUT NOT REALLY REALLY TRY IT, TO THE FULELST EXTENT POSSIBLE? NO, OUR PROTAGONIST IS A THOROUGH FELLOW AND HE WANTS TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS REALLY DOES MIMIC THE PATTERNS OF HIS OWN LIFE. IF THIS THING ROLLS INTO THE TERRITORY OF KILLING OR CANDY CRUSHING, THEN WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT: PLAY. SO THE PROTAGONIST OF OUR BOOK STARTS PLAYING THE GAME HE DESIGNED. FOR SIMPLICITY'S SAKE, HE BEGINS TO WRITE ABOUT THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND: THE EXPERIENCE HE HAS JUST BEEN HAVING. HE STARTS TO DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF THE ROOM THAT HE'S LOOKING AT (PINK) AND THE THINGS THAT ARE IN IT (A PERSON AND A DESK AND SOMETHING TO WRITE ON), THEN POSITS THAT THIS NOT ONLY REPRESENTS A SETTING AND A PROTAGONIST, BUT ALSO A CONFLICT, IN AS MUCH AS THE CHARACTER IN THE ROOM (THE PROTAGONIST AND SETTING, RESPECTIVELY) NEEDS TO FILL THE WRITING AREA IN FRONT OF HIM, AND THIS IS A SORT OF PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED. FROM THERE, HE IMAGINES WHAT THE WRITER MIGHT BE WRITING ABOUT. AS MANY WRITERS HAVE A GOAL OF ACCURATELY PAINTING A PICTURE OF THEIR OWN LIFES, OUR PROTAGONIST IMAGINES THAT THE PROTAGONIST IN THE NVOEL WIRTTEN BY THE VIDEO GAME CHARACTER OUR PROTAGONIST IS WRITING ABOUT IN HIS BOOK IS TRYING TO DO THE SAME. THE FIRST METHOD OF REPRESENTATION THAT COMES TO MIND IS VIDEO GAMES. YES, HE IMAGINES THAT THE PROTAGONIST IS WRITING ABOUT A GAME, AN IMAGINARY GAME THAT MIGHT BEST REPRESENT HIS LIFE. OF COURSE, HIS LIFE IS ONE THAT IS MUNDANE, MUCH LIKE THE WRITER PLAYING THE GAME, AND DOES NOT CONSIST OF SHOOTING OR KILLING OR EVEN SILLY THINGS LIKE SLASHING AT FRUITS. OUR WRITER, BEING A WRITER, UNDERSTANDS THAT THE WRITER HE'S CONTROLLING WOULD ONLY WANT TO WRITE ABOUT A VIDEO GAME THAT AVOIDS THOSE THINGS, AND IF WE'RE HONEST, WE KNOW HE KNOWS THAT THIS WRITER WHICH IS HIM IS ALREADY DESTINED TO WRITE ABOUT A WRITER TRYING TO WRITE, AND THAT A VIDEO GAME REPRENSETING THE STRUGGLE OF A WRITER TO DO SO WOULD BE THE ONLY GAME HE'D LIKE TO SEE COME TO FRUITION. SO OUR WRITER, PLAYING THE GAME HE INVENTED, CONTROLS THE SPRITE TO WRITE ABOUT A WRITER WHO ENVISIONS A GAME ABOUT A MAN WHO NEEDS TO WRITE SOMETHING, BUT IS CONSTRAINED. THERE ARE NUMEROUS CONTSTRAINTS AVAIALBE, BUT HE GOES WITH THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE: TIME. IT'S OBVIOUS TO HIM BECAUSE IT IS ALSO THE CONSTRAINT OF THE GAME HIS PLAYING AND WHICH HE INVENTED. SO IT IS NO BIG LEAP TO HAVE THE SPRITE IN THE GAME WRITE ABOUT A GAME WHERE THERE IS THE SAME OBSTACLE. AND  IT IS AT THIS MOMENT THAT TIME ACTUALLY ENTERS THE ROOM. THE WRITER, IN THE MIDDLE OF PLAYING THE GAME, BARELY EVEN NOTICES TIME'S ARRIVAL. BUT THERE HE IS. TIME PUSHES WRITE INTO THE WRITER AND STOPS HIM FROM PLAYING, STOPS HIM FROM WRITING WHAT THE PLAYER IN THE GAME WOULD WRITE. TIME THREATENS TO UNDO WHAT HE HAS ALREADY DONE. BUT OUR WRITER WILL HAVE NONE OF THAT! NO, HE READIES FOR BATTLE. SO DOES TIME. OUR WRITER STANDS AND WE SEE QUICKLY THAT HIS HEALTHBAR HAS APPEARED. SO HAS TIME'S. TIME'S IS ENORMOUS IN COMPARISON TO THE WRITER'S. THE WRITER'S HEALTH BAR IS PITIFUL. TIME'S IS AWE INSPIRING. IT SEEMS TO GO ON FOREVER. YET THE WRITER DOES NOT STAND DOWN. THEY BEGIN TO FIGHT. THE WRITER BEGINS TO LOSE.
