# Durations

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description
Durations was made as part of a collaboration with Marina Abramovic and [MAI](http://www.marinaabramovicinstitute.org/). It was written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/), using the [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com/) library. Sound effects were made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/).

Durations has been featured on [Kill Screen](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/news/pippin-barr-wants-you-feel-pain-longer-duration/), [Kotaku&#8217;s Watchlist](http://watchlist.kotaku.com/one-minute-speed-date-and-other-weird-games-1513533253/@Stevemarinconz), [IndieGames.com](http://indiegames.com/2014/03/pippin_barrs_durations_how_lon.html), and [Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2014/03/18/games-that-last-for-one-second-one-millenium-in-pippin-barrs-d/). It has also, rather impressively, [been reviewed from inside itself](http://durationsreview.tumblr.com/). And here is a nice piece of writing about [Durations and Mountain](https://alexdavidjones.wordpress.com/2015/09/16/archive-time-and-timelessness-mountain-and-durations/) from Alex David Jones.
